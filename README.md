## Instruction

- There are two main directories for Diffusion and MPEA. Each of these directories contain 6 python scripts corresponding to the 6 experimental setup as discussed in the paper.
- Extracted information files can be found inside each of the above mentioned directories.
- analyze_and_create_homework.ipynb was a google colab notebook used to analyze the extracted information, do alignment, and create prepare the data for manual annotation.
- Please refer to README(grobid_usage).md for instructions (my notes) on how to install and run Grobid server and client.
- All pre-requisites for running the code are mentioned in the requirements.txt file.
