        "evidence": "Phase and Microstructure of the Sintered WMoNbCrTi HEAs Figure  3a  shows the XRD patterns of the WMoNbCrTi HEAs sintered from the various powders. To investigate the phase evolution during the SPS process, the XRD patterns for the 30 h milling powder and the corresponding bulk sample are comparatively analyzed in Fig.  3b . It is clear that the bulk alloys are composed of two BCC solid solution phases (W-rich and Ti-rich phases) and a Laves phase. The phase amounts estimated using the peak area of XRD are shown in Table  II . It is clear that the amount of Laves phase for the 30-HEAs reached the maximum value of 3.92 wt.%. The supersaturated solid solutions formed in the milled HEAs powders are metastable phases and can cause phase transformation.  24, 25, 27  In addition, the ball milling produces high dislocation density and a significant volume fraction of grain boundaries, leading to a substantial amount of excess energy stored in the powders.  26, 28  Accordingly, the low activation energy of the phase change caused by the excess energy significantly promotes the transition during the sintering.  29  Therefore, as shown in Fig.  3b , the phase transformation from solid solution phases (Nb-rich and Cr-rich phases) in the powders to Laves phase in the bulk alloy occurred during the SPS process. The SEM morphologies of the sintered WMoNbCrTi alloys are presented in Fig.  4 . With increased milling time, the HEAs exhibit a more homogeneous and refined microstructure. The different contrasts in Fig.  4  represent the various phases, and the corresponding compositions of these phases measured by EDS are shown in Fig.  5 . Combing the results of the XRD (Fig.  3a ) and the EDS (Fig.  5a  and b ), the dark and white zones in Fig.  4  are BCC solid solution phases, and they are enriched in Ti (Fig.  5a ) and W (Fig.  5b ), respectively. The Laves phase was detected in the sintered WMoNbCrTi HEAs, enriched in Cr and Nb and depleted in W, Mo and Ti, as seen in Fig.  5c . It is clear that the phase transformation from solid solution phase to Laves phase occurred during the SPS process. The type of phase in the HEAs is strongly dependent on the difference in the atomic size, and the great difference in the atomic radius could promote the formation of the compound.  30  In general, the composition of the Laves phase in a binary system is described by the formula AB 2 , where the atomic size of element A is larger than that of element B. As reported by Zhang et al.  31  the Cr-rich Laves phase was described as Cr 2 Nb in the CoCrMoNbTi alloy. It was also reported that the Laves phase was described by the formula (Nb,Ti)(Al,Cr,V) 2 in the NbTiAlCrV system.  8, 32  In the refractory WMoNbCrTi system, the binary systems of Nb-Ti, Nb-W, Nb-Mo, Cr-W and Cr-Mo could form infinite solid solution, but the binary systems of Cr-Nb and Cr-Ti could form Laves phases, and the phase stability of Cr-Nb is better than that of Cr-Ti.  33  In the WMoNbCrTi system, the differences in atomic radius between Nb (150 Pm) and Cr (128 Pm) caused lattice distortion, which would destabilize the Nb-rich and Cr-rich solid solution phases and promote the formation of the Laves phase during the SPS process. According to the results of the XRD (Fig.  3 ) and EDS (Fig.  5c ), the Laves phase in the WMoNbCrTi system could be defined as (Nb, Ti)(Cr, Mo, W) 2 . Density of the Sintered WMoNbCrTi HEAs According to the rule of mixtures, the calculated theoretical density for the WMoNbCrTi HEA is 9.92 g/cm  3  . Figure  6a  shows the relative density of the WMoNbCrTi HEAs SPSed from the different powders. It is clear that, as the milling time increased from 5 h to 40 h, the relative density of the HEAs dropped slightly from 98.8% to 97.5%. This phenomenon is often found in the powder metallurgy materials. The decrease in the relative density could be attributed to the work hardening of the powders milled for a long time, which made the powders difficult to sinter.  34  Hardness and Fracture Toughness of the Sintered WMoNbCrTi HEAs Figure  6b  shows the Vickers hardness and fracture toughness of the various HEAs. As the milling time increased from 5 h to 40 h, the hardness of the HEAs first increased and then decreased, and it reached the maximum value of 10.40 GPa in the  30-HEAs. Three main reasons contributed to the maximum hardness in the 30-HEA: (1) the workhardening effect in the HEA powders milled for a long time,  35  (2) the precipitation strengthening effect owing to the largest amount of Laves phase distributed in the matrix of solid solution and (3)  grain size refinement of the alloy sintered with the long-time milling powders.  36  In addition, the fracture toughness of the HEAs exhibits an opposite trend to the hardness. The 5-HEAs exhibited a maximum fracture toughness value of 7.16 MPa m 1/2 , which is about 40% higher than that of the 30-HEAs. The lowest fracture toughness for the 30-HEAs is also attributed to the largest amount of the brittle Laves phase in the alloys (Table  II ). Compressive Properties of the Sintered WMoNbCrTi HEAs The compressive stress-strain (r-e) curves, compressive strength and fracture strain for the WMoNbCrTi HEAs tested at room temperature are shown in Fig.  7 . The results show that the milling duration of powders has a considerable influence on the compressive strength and plasticity   of the HEAs. The yield strength and fracture strength of the 5-HEAs reached the values of 2492 MPa and 2765 MPa, and the corresponding compressive strains were 5.6% and 9.8%, respectively, which are remarkably superior to the refractory HEAs fabricated by the vacuum arc melting.  11  The highest compressive strength of the HEA is attributed to the 5 h milling powder having softer and irregular particles, which are easy to contact and deform during the SPS process."
