        "evidence": "A composition of high-purity raw materials 12.7 at.% Zr, 30.8 at.% Nb, 17.7 at.% Ti, 30.8 at.% Ta, and 8.0 at.% Hf was arc molten and cast into a cylindrical copper mold. The so-produced rod was recast in a zone-melting setup at a feed rate of 5 mm/h at about 2,300 \u00b0C under 400 mbar argon atmosphere. The final ingot consisted of a single phase of body-centered structure, with single-grain sizes between about 0.5 and 1 mm. Rectangular cuboidal samples of 1.4 \u00d7 1.4 \u00d7 3.2 mm 3 were cut from the ingot using a wire saw. Their surfaces were ground on 1,200 grit SiC paper. Plastic deformation experiments were performed in compression along the long sample axis in a modified ZWICK Z050 uniaxial testing system at constant true strain rate under closed-loop control. The strain was measured directly at the sample by a linear inductive differential transducer at an accuracy of \u00b110 nm. Deformation experiments were performed between room temperature (RT) and 300 \u00b0C at a strain rate of 10 -4 s -1 . The deformation temperatures around RT were controlled by air conditioning the ambient temperature and at elevated temperatures by a cylindrical furnace equipped with an active temperature-gradient control. During the deformation experiments, we performed temperature-cycling tests, stress-relaxation tests, and strain-rate changes in order to determine the thermodynamic activation parameters of the deformation process. The activation volume V was determined by means of stress-relaxation tests, where the total strain is kept constant and the decrease of the stress is measured as a function of the time. The data are evaluated according to  [14]   V \u00bc kT m s @ln\u00f0 _ r\u00de @r T ; (1) where m s is the Schmid factor, k is Boltzmann's constant, T is the deformation temperature, and \u03c3 and _ r are the applied stress and stress rate, respectively. The activation enthalpy \u0394H was determined from temperature-cycling experiments according to  [14]  DH \u00bc \u00c0kT 2 @ln\u00f0_ e\u00de @r T @r @T _ e \u00bc \u00c0m s TV @r @T _ e ; (2) where _ e is the strain rate. Specimens for microstructural characterization were prepared by means of a dual beam FEI Helios Nanolab 400S focused ion beam apparatus from the centers of the deformation samples and from undeformed reference samples. Bragg-contrast TEM was carried out using a Philips CM20 transmission electron microscope operated at 200 kV, and STEM work using a probe corrected FEI Titan 80-300 operated at 300 kV and equipped with a high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) detector.
