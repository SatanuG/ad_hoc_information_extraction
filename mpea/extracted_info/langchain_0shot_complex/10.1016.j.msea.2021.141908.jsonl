        "evidence": "The refractory VNbTa alloys with single body centered cubic (BCC) structure were prepared. The proceed alloy exhibited excellent combination of strength and plasticity. The underlying mechanism was related to the solid solution strengthening effect caused by large atomic size misfit of elements among Nb, Ta and V.\n\nExperimental Alloy ingots with nominal compositions of VNbTa (at. %) were prepared by vacuum arc melting of equimolar pure metals (purity>99.5%, total weight = 65g) in a Ti-gettered high-purity argon atmosphere.\n\nMicrostructure characterization Fig.  1a  exhibits the EBSD inverse pole figure (IPF) of as-cast VNbTa alloy. The random growth direction and irregular shape of grains can be observed in specimen, and the average grain sizes are nearly 44.28 \u03bcm (inset of Fig.  1a ).\n\nTensile mechanical properties of VNbTa alloy at room temperature Fig.  2a  shows the tensile engineering stress-strain curve of VNbTa alloy. The corresponding data of mechanical properties are summarized in Table  s1  and s2. It can be seen that present alloy exhibits the average yield strength (\u03c3 ys ) of \uff5e925 MPa, ultimate tensile strength (\u03c3 ts ) of \uff5e 1050 MPa and fracture elongation (\u03b5 te ) of \uff5e26%, respectively."
