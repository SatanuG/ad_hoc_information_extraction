X-ray diffraction analysis of NbTaTi identified diffraction peaks from a single BCC phase, with the lattice parameter a = 328.5 pm (Figure  3a ). Diffraction peaks from two BCC phases, BCC1 and BCC2, were present on the Xray diffraction patterns from NbTaZr (Figure  3b ). The lattice parameters of these phases were determined to be very close to each other: a BCC1 = 332.0 pm and a BCC2 = 335.4 pm. Smallintensity diffraction peaks from minor phases were also present, which could be assigned to an HCP phase with the lattice parameters a HCP = 320.4 pm and c HCP = 509.4 pm, and an FCC phase with a FCC = 506.5 pm (Figure  3b ). The measured lattice parameters of the HCP phase are similar to that of \u03b1-Zr (a Zr = 322.94 pm and c Zr = 514.14 pm)  [13] , while the measured lattice parameter of the FCC phase is close to the reported lattice parameter of cubic zirconium oxides: Zr 2 O (a=508.8 pm)  [14] , ZrO (a=511.0 pm)  [15]  or ZrO 2 (a=494.7 pm)  [16] . J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f The microstructure of NbTaTi after HIP consisted of coarse, polygonal grains of ~0.4 mm in diameter (Figure  4a ). Adjacent grains were separated by straight grain boundaries, indicating well annealed condition. Higher magnification images revealed precipitation of secondary phases, both inside grains and at grain boundaries (Figure  4b ). Precipitation-free regions were present along areas adjacent to grain boundary precipitates. The average thickness of these precipitate-free regions, inside each grain, was about 2 \u00b5m. An EBSD analysis showed that the matrix phase and intra-granular precipitates have BCC crystal structures, while the grain boundary precipitates have an FCC crystal structure (Figure  4c ). According to EDS analysis, the second-phase precipitates were rich in Ti and depleted in Nb and Ta (Figure  5 , Table  3 ), which is in agreement with their dark appearance on BSE images. The interstitial elements were distributed evenly between the matrix and intra-granular particles; however, the grain-boundary precipitates had an increasing amount of N and decreasing amount of C (Figure  5 ). It is likely that the increased amount of N in the grain boundary precipitates is responsible for their FCC crystal structure  [17, 18] . The volume fraction of the Ti-rich second phases was ~13.1%. Since the X-ray diffraction pattern from NbTaTi showed the diffraction peaks from a single BCC phase only, it is likely that the lattice parameters of the BCC matrix phase and the BCC Ti-rich precipitates are similar. The volume fraction of grain-boundary precipitates with the FCC crystal structure is small, ~1%, and the diffraction peaks from this phase are likely shielded by the background X-ray diffraction intensity."

J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f The microstructure of NbTaZr was very different from that of NbTaTi. It consisted of finer equiaxed grains of ~40 \u00b5m in diameter (Figure  6a ). Coarse, needle-like or plate-like, dark second-phase particles were present at grain boundaries, some of which propagated inside the grains. The grain interior consisted of the nano-lamellar mixture of two co-continuous phases (Figure  6b, c ). EDS maps revealed that the nano-lamellae, which looked dark on the BSE images, were rich with Zr and depleted in Nb and Ta, while the nano-lamellae, which looked brighter on the BSE images, were rich in Nb and Ta (Figure  7 ). It was not possible to identify exact chemical compositions of these BCC nano-lamellar phases, as the electron beam excitation area was larger than the lamellar thickness. In average, these intragranular regions were rich in Ta and depleted in Zr (Table  4 ). EDS analysis also showed that dark coarse particles at grain boundaries were rich in Zr and O (Figure  7 , Table  4 ). It is quite possible that these coarse particles were present during HIP at 1400\u00b0C, together with the matrix phase, thus preventing the matrix grains to grow and explaining the relatively low grain size in this alloy. The volume fraction of the coarse, Zr-rich particles was estimated to be ~5-8%. J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f  A TEM analysis was also used to study the fine and complex microstructure of the NbTaZr alloy. A thin foil was extracted from a region containing both nano-lamellae of Ta and Zr rich phases and coarse, plate-like Zr-rich particles (Figure  8 ). The TEM-EDS analysis showed that the Ta-rich lamellae are actually a continuous matrix phase with the composition shown in Table  5 . The fine lamellae inside the matrix are rich in Zr, but they also contain relatively large amount (~40.2%) of Nb and Ta. Coarse, plate-like particles are heavily enriched in Zr (~85.5%, Table  5 ), in agreement with SEM/EDS analysis. The detected amounts of N and O are in the range of 0.1 -3.3% and 1.8 -2.9%, respectively, with the lowest amount in the Ta-rich matrix and higher"
