Microstructure, room temperature and elevated temperature mechanical properties of this newly-designed alloy have been reported in as cast and heat-treated conditions. The homogenized and continuously cooled (water quenching or air cooling) conditions of this alloy consist of a nanoscale mixture of a disordered BCC and an ordered B2 phases, while subsequent low temperature annealing treatment leads to the formation of additional phases. In the homogenized condition, the yield stress of the alloy is 1050 MPa at 23 \u00b0C, 852 MPa at 400 \u00b0C and 1059 MPa at 600 \u00b0C. Above 600 \u00b0C, the yield stress decreases rapidly with increasing temperature becoming 250 MPa at 800 \u00b0C and less than 50 MPa at 1000 \u00b0C and 1200 \u00b0C."

X-ray diffraction patterns of the specimens deformed at 23, 400, and 800 \u00b0C revealed essentially single-phase BCC structure (see Fig.  5  ). After deformation at RT, the diffraction peaks became wider than in the 1100 \u00b0C annealed and water quenched specimen and all the diffraction peaks belonged to a sole BCC phase (see Fig.  5 a ). No peak shoulders were observed contrary to the annealed sample. A small diffraction peak from a minor, unidentified phase located near 2 \u0398 = 31.4\u00b0or  34.1\u00b0w  as present on the diffraction patterns of 400 \u00b0C or 800 \u00b0C deformed specimens (see Fig.  5 b, d ). At the same time, three major phases: disordered BCC, ordered cubic B2 and ordered hexagonal AlZr 2 ,--were clearly identified in the specimen deformed at 600 \u00b0C (see Fig.  5 c ). Additionally, a diffraction peak from a minor, unidentified phase located near 2 \u0398 = 31.2\u00b0was also present. The lattice parameters of the BCC and B2 phases are given in the respective figures. The lattice parameters of the hexagonal phase are a = 485.6 pm and c = 589.7 pm. SEM and EBSD analysis confirmed a single-phase, coarse-grained structure in the specimens deformed at 23 and 400 \u00b0C.  (see Fig.  6 d ). The evidence of B2 superlattice reflections in the [100] zone axis of the BCC matrix indicates that ordered regions were still present in the microstructure after deformation at 400 \u00b0C (see Fig.  6 e ). Dramatic changes in the microstructure, relative to the WQ condition, occurred after compression deformation at 600 \u00b0C. In these specimens, a nano-meter-sized mixture of at least three phases was ob-served inside grains (see Fig.  7 a ). The different phases were recognized by different Z"
