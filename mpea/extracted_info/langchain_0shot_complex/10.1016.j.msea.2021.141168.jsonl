In the slow cooled condition, the alloy had a coarse-grained structure consisting of Zr-rich BCC matrix and Ta-rich submicron-sized BCC precipitates, which were coherent to the matrix phase. Ti was almost equally distributed between these two phases. omega-phase nano-precipitates were also detected inside the Zr-rich matrix. The HIP'd alloy had high yield stress of 1671 MPa at 25 \u2022 C and 1440 MPa at 400 \u2022 C, but low ductility, likely due to the presence of the omega phase. Considerable alloy softening, accommodated by a noticeable increase in ductility, occurred between 400 \u2022 C and 600 \u2022 C, with the yield stress decreasing to 346 MPa at 600 \u2022 C, 157 MPa at 800 \u2022 C and 103 MPa at 1000 \u2022 C. Such dramatic change in the mechanical behavior was correlated with dissolution of the omega phase and approaching phase equilibrium at T \u2265 600 \u2022 C."
