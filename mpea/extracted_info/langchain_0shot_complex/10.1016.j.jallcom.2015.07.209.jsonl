This represents the first successful attempt to cold roll a HEA with a BCC crystal structure. The microstructure and properties of the rolled sheets were determined in the as-rolled condition and after annealing at 800\u00b0C, 1000\u00b0C, and 1200\u00b0C. Cold rolling resulted in extensive grain elongation, formation of deformation bands within the grains, and development of crystallographic textures that depended on the rolling reduction. The 86.4% cold-rolled sheet had true tensile stress of 1295 MPa and tensile ductility of 4.7%. After annealing at 1000\u00b0C and 1200\u00b0C, complete recrystallization of the cold-rolled sheet occurred. After annealing at 1000\u00b0C, the true tensile stress and ductility of the sheet were 1262 MPa and 9.7%, respectively."

        "evidence": "Sheet annealed at 800\u00b0C Per the x-ray-diffraction analysis, annealing of rolled sheet at 800\u00b0C for 2 h transformed the single-phase BCC material into a two-phase structure comprising BCC1 and BCC2 phases with lattice parameters a 1 = 0.3427 nm and a 2 =0.3338 nm, respectively (Figure  4b ). BSE images taken from longitudinal cross-sections of 65% and 86.4% cold-rolled sheet revealed partiallyrecrystallized microstructure with fine second-phase particles precipitated inside nonrecrystallized grains, often along deformation bands (Figure  9  and 10). Second-phase particles were not present inside the recrystallized grains. Figure  11a  and Figure  11b  show the crystallographic orientations of recrystallized and non-recrystallized grains, as well as second phase particles, along the transverse and normal directions, respectively, of the sheet rolled to the 86.4% reduction. The corresponding image-quality (IQ) map for this region (Figure  11c ) allowed identification of the non-recrystallized grains. Dark lines on the IQ map corresponded to matrix/second-phase-particle interfaces, as well as the retained deformation bands; and light regions revealed the defect-free, recrystallized grains. While most of the non-recrystallized grains had preferred orientations of <001> and <111> in ND, the recrystallized grains did not. In addition, many of the second-phase particles had crystal orientations similar to that of the parent (matrix) grains. Chemical analysis revealed that the recrystallized grains were slightly enriched in Hf and Zr, while the particles were slightly enriched in Ta and Nb (Table  4 ). The composition of the non-recrystallized grains with second-phase particles was close to the average composition of the alloy. In light of the fact that the atomic radii of Hf and Zr are considerably larger than those of the other alloying elements, it was surmised that the matrix had the BCC1 structure (i.e., the phase with the larger lattice parameter), and the particles comprised the BCC2 crystal structure. \n Sheet annealed at 1000\u00b0C After annealing at 1000\u00b0C for 2 h, the cold-rolled structure was completely recrystallized (Figure  12 ). The alloy comprised a single-phase BCC structure with a lattice parameter similar to that of the material prior to rolling (Figure  4c ). Many grains had preferred <111> orientations parallel to the normal direction of the sheet (Figure  13  a, b), and the majority of the grain boundaries had misorientation angles above 10\u00b0 (Figure  13c ). The average grain size in samples that had been rolled to 65% and 86.4% reduction was 35\u00b15 \u00b5m and 22\u00b13 \u00b5m, respectively. \n Sheet annealed at 1200\u00b0C After annealing at 1200\u00b0C for 2 h, the cold-rolled sheets retained their single-phase BCC crystal structure, and the x-ray-diffraction patterns were similar to that shown in Figure  4c . The annealed material exhibited an equiaxed grain structure with average size of ~91 \u00b5m or 76 \u00b5m for samples that had been rolled to 65% or 86.4% reduction, respectively (Figure  14a, b ). These grain sizes were ~3 times larger than those after annealing at 1000\u00b0C. Moreover, fine secondphase precipitates with a dendritic morphology were observed within the recrystallized grains and at the grain boundaries (Figure  14c, d ). Because of their small size and volume fraction, the composition and crystal structure of these precipitates could not be identified by SEM/EDS/EBSD."
