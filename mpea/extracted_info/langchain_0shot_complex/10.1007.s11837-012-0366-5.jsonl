For simplicity, they are denoted by V0, V0.25, V0.75, V1, V1.5, V2, and V3, respectively) are shown in Fig.  1 . It is seen that all alloys mainly contain a bcc solidsolution phase. The XRD patterns of V0, V0.25, V0.5, V0.75, and V1 alloys seem to exhibit reflections of only a single bcc phase. But overlapping peaks are present in the patterns, which implies that the bcc phase separation may exist in these alloys. As the molar ratio of V increases to 1.5, 2, and 3, reflections of a Zr-rich phase (b-Zr) with a bcc structure are observed on the diffraction patterns besides the matrix bcc solid solution. The peaks of the matrix bcc reflections shift rightwards as the V content increases, with little difference between V0 and V0.25 alloys. This trend demonstrates that the lattice parameter decreases, as the V content is increased according to the Bragg equation, which is mainly due to Zr depletion in the matrix phase to form Zr-rich bcc phase. Zr has much larger atomic size than 3d transition metals. The X and d values of TiZrNbMoV x alloys were calculated and listed in Table  I . It is obvious that the X and d values of the alloys are located in the area for forming solid-solution phase that is X \u2021 1.1 and d \u00a3 6.6%. Figure  2  shows the SEM back-scattering electron images of TiZrNbMoV x alloys. Typical cast dendritic and interdendritic structures were observed in the alloys. When the molar ratio of V increases to 1.5 and 2, the Zr-rich phase appears in the interdendrite. The overall microstructures become finer and phase contrast becomes more apparent with the increasing V contents, which indicates that V addition promotes bcc phase separation."

Both Nb0 and Nb0.1 alloys exhibit the reflections of a single bcc solid-solution phase. However, the reflections of the Laves phase, which is identified as (CoCr) 2 Nb type with a hexagonal close-packed lattice structure, appear in the XRD patterns of Nb0.25, Nb0.5, and Nb0.75 alloys. The X and d value of alloys are also listed in Table  I . We can see that as the Nb content increases, the d value increases and X value decreases. It implies that the stability of the solid-solution phase decreases with the Nb addition; thus, ordered Laves phase appears in Nb-contained alloys. Compared with the other four alloys, the Nb0.75 alloy is not located in the formation area of solid-solution phases, and the Nb0.75 alloy contains more Laves phases.  24  The microstructures of as-cast CoCrFeNiAlNb x alloys were displayed in Fig.  5 . Figure  5a  shows a typical dendritic morphology with an average primary arm spacing of 15 lm to 25 lm for the Nb0.1 alloy and a small amount of the Laves phases distribute in the interdendritic regions. The Nb0.25 and Nb0.5 alloys (as shown in Fig.  5b, c , respectively) both display the typical hypoeutectic structure. The primary phase is the bcc solid-solution phase. The continuous network eutectic structure is a mixture of the bcc phase and the Laves phase that nucleate and grow alternately in the interdendritic regions. For the Nb0.75 alloy, the primary phase is not the bcc phase but the Laves phase of a white flower-shaped morphology shown in Fig.  5d . The eutectic structure consists of the bcc phase and the Laves phase, which presents a hypereutectic structure for the alloy. As a result, the microstructure changes from single bcc solid solutions (x = 0 and x = 0.1) to a hypoeutectic structure (x = 0.25 and x = 0.5) and then to a hypereutectic structure (x = 0.75) in this alloy system."
