        "evidence": "The quaternary CrNbTaTi alloy showed excellent malleability at all three temperatures surviving true plastic strain of 0.69 without fracture. The yield stress of this alloy was 515 MPa at 25 \u2022 C, 62 MPa at 1000 \u2022 C and only 20 MPa at 1200 \u2022 C. At these three temperatures, the alloy showed weak strain hardening during the whole deformation process and achieved the true peak (maximum) stress at the end of deformation. CrNbTaTi has the microstructure, which is morphologically similar to that of CrNbTi, but CrNbTaTi has very good ductility at all studied temperatures, although this is at the expense of strength. The difference in the mechanical behavior of these two alloys is likely due to a considerably smaller amount of Cr (~13 %, Table  5 ) in the BCC phase, decreased volume fraction of Laves and finer Laves phase particles in CrNbTaTi than in CrNbTi. Due to smaller amount of Cr, the BCC phase in CrNbTaTi is softer, which results in decreasing yield and flow stresses in this alloy relative to CrNbTi. It is likely that the softer BCC phase in CrNbTaTi does not allow internal stresses to achieve critical values for fracturing finer Laves particles, thus providing increased ductility."
