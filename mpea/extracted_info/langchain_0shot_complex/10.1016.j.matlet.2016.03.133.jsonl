        "evidence": "HfMo x NbTaTiZr alloys (x \u2264 1) have a simple BCC structure. The lattice parameters of these alloys decrease with an increase in Mo concentration, but their densities show an opposite trend. The microstructures of all studied alloys correspond to a typical dendritic structure. No other phases were formed in the interdendrite region. The yield strength of the studied alloys increases from 1015 MPa to 1512 MPa with an increase in Mo concentration from zero to 16.7 at.% indicating a significant solid solution strengthening in the HfMo x NbTaTiZr alloys due to Mo addition. The obtained HfMo x NbTaTiZr alloys show excellent room-temperature plasticity. The studied alloys, except for the Mo-1 alloy, underwent a 50% compression strain without any evidence of fracture. The HfMo x NbTaTiZr c 2921 \uf03d \uf044\uf073alloys can be considered as quasi-binary alloys, and a linear correlation between their yield strength and a solute atom concentration is established."
