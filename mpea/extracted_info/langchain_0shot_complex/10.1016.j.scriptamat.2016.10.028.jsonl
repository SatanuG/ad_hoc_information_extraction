The bcc solid solution phases with the different lattice constants were obtained in as-cast and annealed states. Arc-melted ingots were prepared by mixing lumps of the pure elements. To achieve a homogeneous distribution of the constituent elements in the alloy, the alloy was melted N 10 times and maintained in a liquid state for approximately 300 s during each melting event. The annealed samples were obtained by vacuum annealing at 1273 K for 168 h."

The values of \u03c3 0.2 in the TiNbTaZrMo HEAs are higher than those of the refractory TiNbTaZrHf HEA and Ti-6Al-4V alloys. The annealing was effective in improving the deformability of the TiNbTaZrMo HEA, which may be related to the grain coarsening and/or redistribution of the constituent elements in the main-dendrite and inter-dendrite regions. The TiNbTaZrMo HEA shows high yield strength and good deformability."

(d1, d2) TEM analysis results of as-cast sample: (d1) TEM-BF image and (d2) SAED pattern in [011] direction. Fig. 2c1-c5 shows the elemental mapping obtained using EPMA, focusing on the distribution of the constituent elements and chemical homogeneity in the main-dendrite (A) and inter-dendrite (B) regions in the as-cast TiNbTaZrMo HEA. The regions A and B both contained all the constituent elements, which led to the formation of multicomponent solid solution phases. The region A was enriched with Ta, Nb, and Mo, whereas Ti and Zr were concentrated in region B. The composition analysis results obtained by EPMA-wavelength dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (WDS) were as follows: in the region A, Ti 15.5 \u00b1 0.4 [at%], Nb 22.4 \u00b1 0.4 [at%], Ta 30.8 \u00b1 0.8 [at%], Zr 8.4 \u00b1 0.5 [at%], and Mo 22.9 \u00b1 0.6 [at%]; whereas, in the region B, Ti 24.7 \u00b1 0.2 [at%], Nb 13.6 \u00b1 0.6 [at%], Ta 7.7 \u00b1 0.5 [at%], Zr 40.9 \u00b1 1.5 [at%], and Mo 13.1 \u00b1 0.6 [at%]."
