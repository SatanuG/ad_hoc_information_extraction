The chemical compositions of different regions labelled using the blue, red and yellow frames in Fig.  2  are listed in Table  1 . The chemical compositions of the base alloy Mo 0.5 NbHf 0.5 ZrTi or Si 0 are very close to the nominal compositions as shown in Table  1  and its microstructure exhibits no obvious feature, in which all elements are distributed homogenously. After adding Si into the base alloy, Si 0.1 alloy exhibits obvious dendritic and interdendritic structure. The interdendrites are composed of interlamellar two phases. The chemical compositions analysis shows that there is no any Si element detected in the dendrites and Si element is only detected in the interdendrites. The exact chemical compositions of the two lamellar structure are not be detected because of their small dimension. According to the XRD results, there are only two phases of BCC phase and M 5 Si 3 phase in this alloy. Thus one phase in the interdendrites is the same as that in the dendrites. It is well known that the lighter elements are darker in the BSE images. It can be inferred that the dark lamellar phase is M 5 Si 3 phase. It Si 0.3 alloy also exhibits the dendritic structure and the interdendrites are the lamellar structure while the volume of the interdendrites increases compared with Si 0.1 alloy. With the further increase of Si content, some large dark phase forms. In Si 0.5 alloy, some irregularly shaped dark phase forms in the dendrites or at the edge of the interdendrites. When the content of Si is 0.7, the dark phases exhibit lath like structure. The volume fraction of the lath like structure increases when the content of Si reaches to 0.9. According to the results of XRD and chemical compositions, it can be fairly asserted that these dark phases labelled using the yellow frames are also M 5 Si 3 phase. The chemical compositions analysis shows that the BCC phase is enriched with Mo, Nb and Ti while the M 5 Si 3 phase is enriched with Zr. The Hf element is distributed in all studied alloys. It can be concluded that the microstructure is proeutectic phase of BCC solid solution phase and eutectic structure of BCC phase and M 5 Si 3 phase in Si 0.1 and Si 0.3 alloys, the microstructure tends to exhibit the proeutectic phase of M 5 Si 3 phase and eutectic structure of BCC phase and M 5 Si 3 phase in Si 0.5 , Si 0.7 and Si 0.9 alloys. Thus, it can be inferred that the microstructure may exhibit the evolution from hypoeutectic structure to eutectic structure and then to hypereutectic structure with the increase of Si concentration in Mo 0.5 NbHf 0.5 ZrTiSi x alloys."

        "evidence": "In this study, Si is added into Mo 0.5 NbHf 0.5 ZrTi alloy to produce the BCC/M 5 Si 3 in-situ compounds. The microstructure and mechanical properties were characterized and discussed. Based on obtained results and analysis, the conclusions can be drawn as follows. (1) The Si-containing alloys are composed of BCC phase and intermetallic M 5 Si 3 phase, the (2) When Si content is lower than x=0.5, the microstructure exhibits the hypoeutectic structure, the microstructure is very closed to the eutectic structure and the microstructure is the hypereutectic structure.

In-situ (Mo 0.5 NbHf 0.5 ZrTi) BCC /M 5 Si 3 compounds were prepared successfully. 2. Mo 0.5 NbHf 0.5 ZrTiSi x alloy has a BCC phase and M 5 Si 3 phase. 3. Microstructure evolves from hypoeutectic to hypereutectic with increasing Si. 4. The addition of Si increases the hardness and strength. 5. The yield strength and plasticity are improved for Si 0.1 alloy.
