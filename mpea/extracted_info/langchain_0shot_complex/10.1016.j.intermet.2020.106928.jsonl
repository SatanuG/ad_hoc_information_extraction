        "evidence": "Though Nb 25 Mo 25 Ta 25 W 25 RHEA has excellent high temperature performance, its ductility is quite poor at room temperature, which hinders the alloy's engineering application. Some investigations have been done to improve the ductility and strength of Nb 25 Mo 25 Ta 25 W 25 RHEAs by alloying with V, Ti, Re and Cu  [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . For example, the yield strength of NbMoTaW RHEA at room temperature was improved from 1058 MPa to 1246 MPa by V alloying while it still maintained the low fracture strain  [14] . Ti alloying obviously enhanced both the strength (from 1058 MPa to 1343 MPa) and ductility (from 2.6% to 14.1%) of NbMoTaW RHEA  [15] . It is confirmed that different alloying elements have different strengthening effect on the NbMoTaW RHEA. Some elements merely strengthen the alloy without any improvement of ductility while others enhance both the strength and ductility. However, the effect of alloying element on this alloy's mechanical properties, such as strength and ductility, is still unclear up to now, and needs systematic investigations. In present work, elements with high melting points over 1850 \u2022 C, such as Cr, Zr, V, Hf and Re, were employed to alloy the NbMoTaW RHEA and improve its mechanical properties. The alloying elements with high melting temperatures over 1850 \u2022 C were merely chosen in order to not weaken the alloy's high temperature resistance. The mechanical properties of the alloyed NbMoTaWX (X = Cr, Zr, V, Hf and Re) RHEAs were predicted by theoretical calculations combined with experimental verifications. The influence of alloying elements on the mechanical properties of NbMoTaWX (X = Cr, Zr, V, Hf and Re) RHEAs was investigated at the atomic scale based on the bonding strength and electronic structure."

As seen, the strength and ductility of the alloyed RHEAs were obviously improved. Compared with NbMoTaW RHEA, the yield stress of NbMoTaWX RHEAs increases by 10-66%. X V RHEA has the large yield strength and reaches about 1460 MPa. The peak stress is also increased up to 50% compared with that of NbMoTaW RHEA. X Zr RHEA has the maximum peak stress and reaches about 1822 MPa. From the stress-strain curves, it is obviously seen that the strength and ductility of X Zr RHEA have a noteworthy improvement. The peak strain of X Zr RHEAs reaches about 15.9%, much larger than that of NbMoTaW RHEA. The experimental data well agrees with the results based on the calculated elastic constants and modulus."

The \u03b4, VEC, E f , and E c indicate that the alloyed NbMoTaWX RHEAs have a BCC single-phase solid solution structure. Most of the alloying elements (X = Cr, Zr, V, Hf and Re) enhanced the strength of NbMoTaW RHEA, while only Zr-alloying improved both the strength and ductility simultaneously. The strengthening mechanism was well analyzed based on the electronic structures. The formation of partial Zr-Zr metallic bonds effectively improved the strength and ductility of NbMoTaW RHEA from the perspective of experiments and theoretical predictions. The calculated results are in good agreement with the experimental data, which suggests an effective strategy for the strengthening of the NbMoTaW RHEA via alloying."
