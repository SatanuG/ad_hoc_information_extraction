However, a maximum intensity level of about 16 is noted which is most probably related to the presence of very large grains (~ 600 microns) within the distribution of grain size. Unindexed areas in some grains seen in Fig.  3b  (see the left side of the image) are related to micro-segregation in the interdendritic zones  [17] ."
