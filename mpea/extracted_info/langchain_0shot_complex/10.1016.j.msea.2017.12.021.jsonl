The yield strength of the WNbMoTaV HEA studied in this work was significantly enhanced over that of arc-melted and cast WNbMoTaV HEA, which has a yield strength of 1,246 MPa and an 80 \u03bcm grain size. The ultra-high mechanical properties of this alloy are attributed to the following effects: solid solution strengthening arising from a severe lattice distortion, which is an inherent characteristic of HEAs, solid solution strengthening by interstitial elements such as C and O, grain boundary strengthening governed by the Hall-Petch relationship and Orowan strengthening by oxide inclusions."
