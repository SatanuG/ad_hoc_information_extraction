Some surface bulging occurs and the bottom side of the sample deforms more extensively than the top part (Fig.  6a ), which is likely due to the presence of a temperature gradient between the top and bottom anvils. White, Zr-rich spots, present in the homogenized alloy  [12]  and in the alloy after RT deformation (Fig.  2 ), are not seen in the 1273 K deformed sample. Instead, characteristic bands at grain boundaries and inside the grains are formed (Fig.  6b ). Higher magnification images (Fig.  6c  and d ), as well as EBSD analysis (Fig.  7 ), show that these bands consist of fine, recrystallized grains and have a fine duplex structure consisting of a mixture of the second-phase precipitates and transformed matrix. The second-phase particles, which have a dark color on the BSE images (Fig.  6c  and d ), become larger and their volume fraction increases, as compared to the non-deformed sample  [12]  or the sample deformed at room temperature (Fig.  2 ). EDS analysis indicates that, inside the bands, the matrix is enriched with Zr and second-phase particles are depleted of Zr (Table  4 ). In the regions outside the deformation bands, where the second-phase particles are not detected, the non-transformed matrix has a composition that is close to the average alloy composition. EBSD analysis indicates that both the matrix and second-phase particles have BCC crystal structures, and the particles have the same crystallographic orientations as the respective matrix grains (Fig.  7 ). The presence of internal stresses inside the grains, especially near grain boundaries, is recognized by continuous change in the orientation of the crystal lattice (Fig.  7d )."
