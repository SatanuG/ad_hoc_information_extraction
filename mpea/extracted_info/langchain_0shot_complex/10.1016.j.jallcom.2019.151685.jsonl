        "evidence": "The produced alloys, except MW1, had single-phase BCC crystal structures. MW1 had small fraction of Ti-rich precipitates located at grain boundaries. The densities of the produced Nb alloys were considerably smaller than the density of C-3009 (10.3 g/cm 3 ). Alloy M4 had the smallest density (\u00bc7.70 g/cm 3 ) and MW1 had the largest density (\u00bc8.94 g cm 3 ) among the reported alloys. W-containing alloys (C-3009, W1 and MW1) were stronger than Mo-containing alloys at T \u00bc 600e1200 C.
