A tiny BCC peak was observed at approximately 31\u00b0in the XRD patterns for the Ti0, Ti0.5, Ti1.0 and some Ti0.2 and Ti0.4 alloys, suggesting that an ordered BCC phase exists in the alloys. The Ti0 and Ti0.2 alloys display a predominant BCC phase accompanied by the Laves phase, which was identified as a Cr 2 Nb type with a hexagonal close-packed (HCP) lattice structure in accordance with the Powder Diffraction File edited by International Center for Diffraction Data (Ref 28). It was clear that the Ti0.4 alloy was only composed of a single BCC crystal structure. Moreover, as the molar ratio of the Ti was increased to 0.5 and 1.0, in addition to strong BCC solid solution diffraction peaks and the Cr 2 Nb Laves phases, there were reflections from another Laves phase with lattice parameters of a = 0.473 nm and c = 1.541 nm. This was subsequently identified as a hexagonal close-packed Co 2 Ti phase."
