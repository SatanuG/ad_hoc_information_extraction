Different from other typical brittle BCC HEAs  [11, 12] , Nb0.25 exhibits relatively ductile deformation behavior with a fracture strain of 14.2%, which might be interpreted from the point of the VEC (valence electron concentration) criterion proposed previously  [32] , i.e., the VEC of Nb0.25 is 4.13, less than the upper limit for ductile HEAs (i.e., 4.4)."
