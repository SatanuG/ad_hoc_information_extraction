The microstructure consisted of coarse (~400 \u03bcm) polygonal-shaped grains with clear boundaries (see a magnified insert in Fig.  3a ); the average chemical composition of the grains corresponded closely to the nominal composition (Fig.  3a , Table  1 ). TEM analysis confirmed the B2 ordering and revealed numerous anti-phase boundaries in the matrix grains (denoted in Fig.  3b  as APBs); no secondary phases were detected. After further annealing at 600\u02daC, which was found to increase the hardness of the alloy noticeably according to preliminary studies, the structure, however, consisted of the bcc and orthorhombic (Cmcmspace group; hereafter denoted as the O-phase) phases (Fig.  2 ). The lattice parameters of the bcc and O-phases were determined as a=0.3311\u00b10.0003 nm and a=0.6068\u00b10.0002 nm, b=0.9648\u00b10.0003 nm, c=0.4710\u00b10.0003 nm, respectively."

Annealing at 600\uf0b0C changed the mechanical properties of the alloy noticeably (Fig.  4 , Table  2 ). At 22\u00b0C, the yield strength increased by ~50% to 1250 MPa; the ductility reduced but maintained at a moderate level of 16% (Fig.  4a ).
