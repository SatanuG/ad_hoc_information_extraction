CALPHAD Modeling Figure  5a  shows the evolution of predicted equilibrium phase mole fraction versus temperature for MoNbTaV. The only crystallization phase is the BCC phase that forms at 2437 \u00b0C, and it is predicted to decompose to a non-equimolar BCC phase and a minor V-rich BCC phase at 456 \u00b0C. The non-equilibrium solidification simulation was accomplished using the Scheil-Gulliver models  [35, 36] , which assume equilibrium mixing in the liquid with no diffusion in the solid. The simulation also predicts the formation of a single BCC solid solution phase as shown in Figure  5b . Simulation on the true bulk composition reveals very similar results; that is, only the BCC phase forms as the primary crystallization phase under both solidification routes, and it is stable over a very wide temperature range."

        "evidence": "The calculated VEC value for MoNbTaV is 5.25, so a BCC structure is expected to form in MoNbTaV. The calculated \u2206\u03c7 value for MoNbTaV is 0.26. It is intuitively expected that low values of \u2206\u03c7 will favor solid solution phase formation, but a prior study  [20]  also shows that empirical parameters such as \u2206\u03c7 and \u2126 are not always effective in separating single-phase compositions from multi-phase ones. Instead, Gao et al.  [9, 11, 32]  have demonstrated an effect approach that combines phase diagram inspection, CALPHAD modeling, first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations, and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. Using this methodology, hundreds of new single-phase HEA compositions have been suggested  [11] . For example, quaternary and higher-order equimolar compositions in the Dy-Er-Gd-Ho-Lu-Sc-Sm-Tb-Tm-Y, Ba-Ca-Eu-Sr-Yb, Mo-Nb-Ta-Ti-V-W, and Mo-Nb-Re-Ta-Ti-V-W systems have been suggested. The thermodynamic properties of the Mo-Nb-Ta-V system have been further studied using CALPHAD. Using BCC phase as the reference state, the calculated entropy of mixing and enthalpy of mixing for BCC phase of MoNbTaV are predicted to be 10.79 J/K/mol and \u00b44.13 kJ/mol, respectively. The entropy of mixing is slightly less than the ideal configurational entropy, suggesting a negative excess entropy for the alloy. Using liquid phase as the reference state, the calculated entropy of mixing and enthalpy of mixing for liquid phase of MoNbTaV are predicted to be 11.31 J/K/mol and \u00b42.97 kJ/mol, respectively. While the mixing entropies and mixing enthalpies for the BCC and liquid phases are fairly consistent for MoNbTaV, the contrasting trend in the mixing properties between BCC and liquid phases are observed in other refractory HEAs  [20, 30] . Using the default states as the reference (the stable structures at pressure of 1 atm and temperature of 25.15 \u02ddC), the total entropy, enthalpy and Gibbs free energy for MoNbTaV are shown in Figure  8 . The calculated total entropy at 300 K is 45.2 J/K/mol, which is about 3.9 times the ideal configurational entropy of 11.53 J/K/mol. This is mainly due to vibrational entropy, which is usually much larger than the configurational entropy as revealed by recent DFT calculations  [45] . For example, DFT calculations  [45]  show that the vibrational entropies for FCC CoCrFeNi, BCC MoNbTaW, and HCP CoOsReRu solid solution phases are already more than twice the ideal configurational entropy at room temperature. Vibrational entropy also scales with increasing temperature. The total enthalpy is \u00b44.09 kJ/mol at T = 27 \u02ddC, but quickly becomes positive with increasing temperature. The Gibbs energy combines the contributions from both enthalpy and entropy, but apparently the contribution from entropy overweighs that from enthalpy for this alloy. To analyze the compositional dependence of the thermodynamic properties, the mixing behavior in entropy, enthalpy and Gibbs free energy for the BCC phase for four pseudo-binaries of MoxNbTaV, MoNbxTaV, MoNbTaxV, and MoNbTaVx at 1000 \u00b0C were calculated as shown in Figure  9 . The entropies of mixing for these systems are fairly comparable and all lie below the ideal configurational entropy, and thus they"

The enthalpy of mixing appears to be sensitive to the alloying elements. The addition of Mo lowers the enthalpy of mixing while the addition of V increases it. The resulting Gibbs free energy largely follows the trend of the enthalpy of mixing, suggesting that enthalpy plays a more important role in phase stability than entropy for the BCC phase among these pseudo-binaries."
