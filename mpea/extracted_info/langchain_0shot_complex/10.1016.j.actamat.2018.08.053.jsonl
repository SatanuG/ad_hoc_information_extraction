Importantly, results indicate that this HEA exhibits the high yield strength and ductility at both room and high temperatures (up to 900 \u00b0C). The typical dendrite microstructure was observed, which is caused by the elemental segregation during the solidification in the as-cast condition. The structural inhomogeneity and chemical segregation were completely eliminated by the proper homogenization treatment at 1,200 \u00baC for 3 days."
