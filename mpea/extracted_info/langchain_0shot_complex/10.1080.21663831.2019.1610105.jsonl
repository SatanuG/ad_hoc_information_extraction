To promote chemical homogeneity, these ingots were re-melted at least eight times and, then, injected into a copper mold (10 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 60 mm 3 ) with water cooling. Phases microstructure of the cast alloys were examined using X-ray diffraction (Cu K \u03b1 radiation, MXP21VAHF) and scanning electron microscopy (ZEISS Supra 55) and results indicated that all samples are bcc single-phase with an average grain size of about 100 \u03bcm. Tensile tests were performed on a CMT4105 universal tensile testing machine with a nominal strain rate of 2.0 \u00d7 10 -4 s -1 at room temperature. Flat dog-bone-shaped tensile samples were electro-discharge machined with a gauge length of 20 mm, width of 3 mm, and thickness of 1 mm. For each alloy, at least two tensile specimens were tested."
