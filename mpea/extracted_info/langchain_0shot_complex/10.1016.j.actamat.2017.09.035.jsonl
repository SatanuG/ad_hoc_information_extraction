Since all Debye Scherrer rings can be attributed to one bcc phase with a lattice constant of 340.2 pm, the TiZrNbHfTa alloy apparently retains its single phase character during HPT processing. This could also be confirmed by complimentary measurements via XRD for which a lattice constant of 341.1 pm was determined, see Fig.  2b )."
