A significant increment in the yield strength with increasing strain rate was observed. The yield strength at \uf07e3.4 \uf0b4 10 3 s -1 was about 40% higher than that measured at \uf07e10 -3 s -1 . Analysis by electron backscatter diffraction shows that in the low strain rate regime (up to \uf07e10 s -1 ) the deformation occurs mainly in evenly distributed bands, while in the dynamic regime the deformation is strongly localized in macroscopic shear bands accompanied by softening even after the onset of yielding.

The difference in the mechanical performance at various strain rates was explained with the help of postmortem microstructure investigations using EBSD and XRD. EBSD investigations revealed strong strain localization in the samples deformed at high strain rates, which may cause the early softening during compression. It was found that the dispersion of shear bands was reduced with increasing strain rate, i.e. the density and the thickness of bands decreased and increased, respectively."
