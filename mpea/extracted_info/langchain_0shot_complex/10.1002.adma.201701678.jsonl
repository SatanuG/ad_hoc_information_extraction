        "evidence": "The equiatomic TaHfZrTi HEA was selected as our prototype alloy and the content of the bcc stabilizer element, i.e., Ta,  [34, 35]  was gradually reduced in order to destabilize the bcc phase in the HEA system (Ta x HfZrTi, denoted as Tax hereafter). A single bcc phase structure was obtained in the quaternary equiatomic Ta1 HEA with only bcc diffraction peaks on its XRD trace. As the Ta content is decreased from 25% (i.e., Ta1) to 16.7% (i.e., Ta0.6), a small amount of hcp phase is detected from the EBSD image, but not captured by XRD. A further decrease of Ta to 14.3% and 11.8% (i.e., Ta0.5 and Ta0.4, respectively) successfully produces a dual-phase microstructure consisting of interwove hcp lamella plates embedded in the bcc matrix. The bcc matrix with a grain size of around 100 \u00b5m and the primary hcp phase, i.e., the interlaced lamellae ranging from tens of nanometers to several micrometers in width, constitute the as-cast alloy Ta0.5. Representative tensile true stress-strain curves of the as-cast Tax HEAs are shown in Figure  3a . Distinct variation can be seen from the alloys with different Ta concentrations. Ta1 (#1) shows high strength (\u22481500 MPa) but very limited plasticity (\u22484%)."

        "evidence": "Experimental Section Alloy ingots with a nominal composition of Ta x HfZrTi (x is from 0 to 1) were prepared by arc-melting a mixture of pure metals with purity over 99.9 at% in a Ti-gettered argon atmosphere. All ingots were remelted at least five times to eliminate chemical imhomogeneity, and eventually drop-cast into a 10 mm \u00d7 10 mm \u00d7 60 mm copper mold. Dog-boneshaped specimens with a thickness of 1.5 mm for tensile tests were cut from the rods by electrical discharge machining. The gauge length and width of the tensile samples are 15 and 5 mm, respectively. Prior to deformation, the samples were polished down to a 2000-grit SiC paper. Tensile tests were performed on a CMT4105 universal electronic tensile testing machine at the strain rate of 1 \u00d7 10 -3 s -1 . For each alloy, at least five tensile tests were conducted and detailed data of mechanical performance of all the tested samples are compiled in Table  S1  (Supporting Information). Phase constitution and microstructure of the alloys were characterized by X-ray diffractometer with Cu K \u03b1 radiation in a 2\u03b8 range from 20\u00b0 to 100\u00b0, a Zeiss Supra55 SEM equipped with an HKL channel 5 system operated at 20 kV and EDS, and a transmission electron microscope (TEM, Tecnai F30) operated at 300 kV. Chemical homogeneity in the alloys was investigated using a LEAP 5000XR APT. Both the APT tip specimens from the region across the phase boundaries between bcc and hcp and TEM specimens were prepared using a focused ion beam (FEI Helios Nanolab 600i). In situ SEM with a maximum load of 1.2 kN was carried on a SEM-servo in situ fatigue testing machine to monitor the lateral surface change under tensile loading. In situ neutron diffraction loading was also conducted by using a MTS load-frame on the VULCAN engineering materials diffractometer, at the Spallation Neutron Source, Oak Ridge National Laboratory.  [46, 47]  The collected neutron diffraction data were reduced and analyzed by single peak fitting using the VDRIVE software.  [48]  The lattice strain \u03b5 hkl of different lattice planes {hkl} were determined by the following formula:  where d hkl and d 0,hkl are the lattice spacing of the {hkl} planes under stress and stress-free state, respectively.  [38, 49]  Besides, the d 0 for (101) hcp is the corresponding lattice spacing of the initial hcp phase. Figure 1 . 1 Figure 1. XRD patterns and EBSD images of the as-cast Tax HEAs. The Ta concentration significantly influences the phase constitution of this alloy system, rendering either single (bcc) or dual-phase (bcc + hcp) structure. The decreasing of Ta content destabilizes the bcc matrix and promotes formation of hcp. Figure 2 . 2 Figure 2.
