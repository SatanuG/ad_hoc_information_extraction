        "evidence": "The as-sintered TiNbTa 0.5 ZrAl 0.5 alloy has a single BCC structure. Cylindrical samples with a diameter of 30 mm and a height of 45 mm were machined from the as-sintered compacts, and then encapsulated in stainless steel cans to avoid severe oxidation and potential fracture during hot forging. The samples were then hot forged at 1500 \u2022 C, 1200 \u2022 C and 800 \u2022 C with a total height reduction of 50 %, and subsequently annealed at the corresponding forging temperature for 30 min (hereinafter refer to as HEA1500, HEA1200 and HEA800, respectively). After the TMP treatments, the stainless steel covering was removed by an electric spark cutting machine. Compression tests at room temperature were conducted in air on a hydraulic testing machine (Instron 8802), while high temperature tests were conducted in vacuum (5 \u00d7 10 -3 Pa) on a dynamic thermal simulation machine (Gleeble-3000). Cylindrical specimens used for compression tests were cut from the TMP samples with axial direction parallel to the forging direction. The dimension of the specimens is 6 mm in diameter and 9 mm in height. All the compression tests were performed at a constant strain rate of 0.001 s -1 . The specimen surfaces were mechanically polished and lubricated by graphite to reduce the friction between the specimen and the punches. During high temperature tests, the specimen was heated to the testing temperature with a heating rate of 10 \u2022 C/s, and soaked at the temperature for 2 min. After compression, the deformed specimen was quenched in water to keep the microstructural characteristics. The phase analysis was performed by using X-ray diffraction (XRD, Advance D8)"
