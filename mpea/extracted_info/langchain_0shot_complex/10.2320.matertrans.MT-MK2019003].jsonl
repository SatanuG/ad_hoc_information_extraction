        "evidence": "Microstructure of as-cast and homogenized RMEAs XRD profiles of as-cast and homogenized RMEAs are shown in Fig.  2 (a) and (b), respectively. All RMEAs were indexed as BCC single phase, besides extra unknown peaks near 30\u00b0in the as-cast (3) HfNbTiZr, (4) HfTaTiZr, the homogenized (2) HfNbTaZr, (3) HfNbTiZr, (4) HfTaTiZr, and (5) NbTaTiZr specimens. The extra peaks might imply short-range ordering formed in these alloys, although it is necessary to be carefully verified in future studies. In the as-cast (4) HfTaTiZr and (5) NbTaTiZr specimens, some peaks showed broadening which could be due to chemical heterogeneities, such as dendritic segregation in as-cast materials, as will be discussed later. Figure  1 (c) expresses a schematic illustration of microstructural change in the as-cast RMEAs along the solidification direction. We found that the microstructure could be divided into three types from bottom to top (along the solidification direction): annealed grains (AG), granular morphology (GM), and dendritic morphology (DM). Formation process of the three kinds of microstructure (AG, GM, and DM) can be explained as follows. During arcmelting and casting, an ingot can be divided into three parts in terms of phase construction. The part close to free surface in the first melting (A) can be fully-liquid phase during melting and solidification, while solid and liquid phases coexist in the middle part (B). The bottom part facing the surface of the mold (C) can be fully-solid phase since that part is continuously cooled during melting and solidification. Subsequent solidification occurs in the B part first and A part afterward, because the latter is far from the mold leading to slower cooling rate. It should be noted that, in the B part, elemental partitioning between solid (where granular-shaped dendrites are nucleated) and liquid phases occurs during solidification, resulting in the GM microstructure. Elemental partitioning also occurs in the A part during dendrite growth, Microstructural observations were also conducted for the homogenized RMEAs, and the fraction of AG, GM, and DM microstructures in both as-cast and homogenized RMEAs were plotted in Fig.  4 . It was found that the fraction of GM and DM reduced to zero in (1) HfNbTaTi, (3) HfNbTiZr and (4) HfTaTiZr after the homogenization at 1150\u00b0C for 24 hours. On the other hand, AG and GM were observed in (2) HfNbTaZr and DM still dominantly remained in (5) NbTaTiZr even after the homogenization. The fraction of AG in (5) NbTaTiZr slightly changed from 9% to 14%. Figure  5 (a)( j) shows elemental distributions in the as-cast and homogenized RMEAs. The left column (a)(e) shows the results of the as-cast alloys, while the right column shows the results of the homogenized alloys. In each figure of (a)( j) upper micrograph is an SEM image of the specimen. Below each SEM image, profiles of element distributions along the thin white line in the corresponding SEM image are represented. The upper and lower graphs indicate for Hf, Ti and Zr (elements showing HCP structure in pure metal state at RT) and for Nb and Ta (elements showing BCC structure in pure metal state at RT), respectively. It should be noted that for convenience in later discussions, we categorize the elements into two categories (namely, BCC elements: Nb and Ta, and HCP elements: Hf, Ti, and Zr) according to their crystal structure in pure metal state at RT. After the homogenization at 1150\u00b0C for 24 hours, it was clear that dendritic segregation was greatly removed in all the homogenized RMEAs. This is because diffusion of elements can be faster at high temperature, resulting in homogeneous distributions of elements in the alloys. However, the most severe segregation in the as-cast (5) NbTaTiZr among five alloys indicated that the homogenization could not remove segregation. Correspondingly, DM with 86% fraction was observed in the homogenized (5) NbTaTiZr, as shown in Fig.  4(b) . Figure  6 (a) and (b) show SEM-BSE micrographs revealing precipitates in the as-cast (2) HfNbTaZr RMEA. A number of lamellar-structured precipitates with sizes of several microns were found along grain boundaries of the matrix BCC phase. Figure  6 (c) gives an EBSD inverse pole figure (IPF) map of a region including the lamellar precipitates. It was interesting that the lamellar precipitates had the same crystal orientation with the matrix grain on the other side of the grain boundary. Figure  6 (d) shows an EBSD phase map of the same area as Fig.  6(c ). Although the lamellae in the precipitates (Fig.  6(b) ) were too fine to be resolved by EBSD, the major portions were determined to be BCC phase, while many fine HCP phases were also observed. The results suggested that the lamellar precipitates were composed of major phase with BCC-based structure and minor phase with HCP-based structure. We found equiaxed precipitates in the homogenized (2) HfNbTaZr RMEA, as shown in Fig.  7 (a). Interestingly, these precipitates having different orientations were aligned along three parallel grain boundaries (GB1, GB2, and GB3) as shown in Fig.  7(b ). As shown in Fig.  7 (c), it was clearly confirmed that equiaxed precipitates had HCP structure while the matrix was BCC (solid solution). It should be noted that no orientation relationship between the matrix and precipitates was found. In addition, the area II of matrix BCC solid solution sandwiched by GB1 and GB2 had the same crystallographic orientation with the matrix area IV in the right-hand side. Similarly, the matrix area I had the same orientation as the area III. Figure  7(d)  gives EDX elemental maps of (Hf, Nb, Ta, and Zr) in the same region involving the equiaxed precipitates. It was found that Hf and Zr were enriched while Nb and Ta were lean in the precipitates, which corresponded with the HCP structure of the precipitates. The results also indicated that the precipitates in the as-cast material could not be totally eliminated by homogenization. A small amount of precipitates was also found in the (4) HfTaTiZr alloy. Figure  8   A d v a n c e V i e w BCC matrix in the as-cast (4) HfTaTiZr RMEA. The precipitates aligned along grain boundaries to form a filmlike morphology, and the thickness of the film-like precipitates was smaller than 100 nm. Figure  8 (c) and (d) show SEM-BSE micrographs of a region around grain boundaries of the matrix phase in the homogenized (4) HfTaTiZr. It was clearly indicated that the precipitates found in the as-cast (4) HfTaTiZr alloy could be successfully eliminated by homogenization. Although those precipitates were observed in the as-cast and homogenized (2) HfNbTaZr alloy and in the as-cast (4) HfTaTiZr, XRD could not detect diffraction peaks corresponding to these second phases probably owing to their small volume fractions, so that the precipitates phase could not be identified furthermore in the current study. It has been said that single phase HEAs and MEAs can be stabilized by their large configuration entropy in solid solutions. However, configuration entropy was not only an important factor but also the mixing enthalpy significantly contributes to the phase stability in HEAs and MEAs.  16, 17)  Based on the present results, it was clearly shown that BCC elements (Nb, Ta) tended to segregate together inside of dendrite arms, separated from HCP elements (Hf, Ti, Zr) in inter-dendrite regions, forming grain boundary precipitates in some cases (e.g., (2) HfNbTaZr).
