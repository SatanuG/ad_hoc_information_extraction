The as-cast HEA exhibits a single-phase ordered body-centred cubic (B2) structure. A hexagonal Zr 5 Al 3 -type second phase is introduced into the HEA through homogenisation treatment, resulting in increase of the yield strength, ultimate compressive strength and fracture strain by 70 MPa, 308 MPa and 9.2%, respectively."
