        "high entropy alloy formula": "Ti 20 Hf 20 Zr 20 Ta 20 Nb 20",
        "microstructure": "EBSD investigations revealed strong strain localization in the samples deformed at high strain rates, which may cause the early softening during compression. It was found that the dispersion of shear bands was reduced with increasing strain rate, i.e. the density and the thickness of bands decreased and increased, respectively.",
        "processing method": "The alloy was obtained by arc-melting under argon atmosphere, followed by high frequency induction melting in a sectorized cooled copper crucible under helium atmosphere, and finally casted by arc melting.",
