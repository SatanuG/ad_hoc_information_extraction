We reveal that dislocation-\u03b2\u2032-phase interactions play a critical role in the mechanical behaviour of the Ti 38 V 15 Nb 23 Hf 24 RHEA. By varying the overall composition in this alloy system, for example, the Ti/V ratio, matrix phase stability and precipitate size can be altered, which leads to different property combinations, paving a feasible pathway for achieving optimal precipitation strengthening in RHEAs."
