Possible control of the microstructure was afterwards demonstrated, using thermomechanical treatments [10, 11]. Some uncommon features were already reported, as for example the case of the recrystallized quaternary bcc TiZrNbHf displaying a yield strength of 880 MPa in tension, at room temperature [12]."
