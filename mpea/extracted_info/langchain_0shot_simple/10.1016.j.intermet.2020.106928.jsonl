The \u03b4, VEC, E f , and E c indicate that the alloyed NbMoTaWX RHEAs have a BCC single-phase solid solution structure. Most of the alloying elements (X = Cr, Zr, V, Hf and Re) enhanced the strength of NbMoTaW RHEA, while only Zr-alloying improved both the strength and ductility simultaneously. The strengthening mechanism was well analyzed based on the electronic structures. The formation of partial Zr-Zr metallic bonds effectively improved the strength and ductility of NbMoTaW RHEA from the perspective of experiments and theoretical predictions. The calculated results are in good agreement with the experimental data, which suggests an effective strategy for the strengthening of the NbMoTaW RHEA via alloying."
