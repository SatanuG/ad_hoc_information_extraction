The thermal activation analysis of experimental data has shown that the process of plastic deformation at low temperatures is controlled by thermally activated motion of dislocations in the Peierls potential relief, which is realized by nucleation and expansion of the kink pairs at dislocation lines. The empirical estimates of the microscopic parameters of dislocation interaction with the Peierls barriers(such as activation energy (energy of kink pair nucleation) and height of the Peierls barrier) and estimates of internal stresses are obtained. Similar values of the activation volume for dislocation motion of Ti 30 Zr 25 Hf 15 Nb 20 Ta 10 high entropy alloy and the bcc metals, where Peierls barriers controls the motion of dislocations, indicate the same deformation mechanism; while differences in activation energy of Ti 30 Zr 25 Hf 15 Nb 20 Ta 10 and the bcc metals probably is due to distorted crystal lattice of the high entropy alloy."
