The multi-principal element alloys M4 and MW1 were considerably stronger showing s 0.2 values of 1100 MPa and 1440 MPa, respectively. All the alloys, except M4 and MW1, showed homogeneous compression deformation, without any evidence of fracture. In the M4 and MW1 alloys, deformation localized inside macroscopic shear bands, which caused cracking and fracture along these bands at true compression strains of ~0.25 and 0.11,  respectively, after achieving peak true stress values of 1757 MPa and 1900 MPa (Fig.  4a ). Due to their reduced density, the developmental alloys showed specific yield stress values superior to the specific yield stress of C-3009 (Table  5 ). The measured compression modulus E of C-3009 was 110 \u00b1 20 MPa (Table  5 ). The error in the measurements was rather    also calculated for the studied alloys and the calculated values are given in Table  5 . The measured microhardness and yield stress values were compared with the calculated elastic moduli of the respective alloys and useful relationships were found. In particular, the alloy microhardness was described as a linear function of the alloy bulk modulus and the yield stress roughly followed a linear dependence on the alloy shear modulus (Fig.  3b  and c ): The yield stress of a solid solution alloy, which contains obstacles for dislocation glide, with the obstacles' density b on the slip plane, can be described by the following equation  [19] : Hv \u00bc 0. s 0.2 \u00bc abG(b) 1/2 (3) Here a is a constant, which depends on the type of obstacles and can vary from ~0.3 for weak obstacles (e.g. solid solutions) to 3.0 for strong obstacles (e.g. precipitates), b is the Burgers' vector value and G is the alloy shear modulus.

The calculated b are in the range from 1.53\u00c210 15 m -2 for alloy M1 to 4.95 x1015 m -2 for alloy MW1. These b values give the average distance between the obstacles of ~26 to 14 nm in the studied alloys. Such high number density of the obstacles in non-deformed singlephase alloys can only be related to solute atoms and their clusters. For example, the typical density of dislocation forest in annealed alloys is ~1x1011 to 3 x1012 m -2 , i.e. 3 to 4 orders of magnitude lower. The observed increase in b with increasing the concentration of the alloying elements in the same alloy families also supports the solidsolution strengthening mechanism in these alloys.
