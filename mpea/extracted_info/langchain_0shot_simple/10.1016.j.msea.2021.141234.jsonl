By controlling the contents of Ti and Al, the lattice distortion and mixing enthalpy of the LHEAs can be effectively adjusted, which suppressed the precipitation formation and resulted in the single BCC structure of the TixAly LHEAs. Moreover, the adding of Ti and Al achieved the balance of density reduction and mechanical property improvement, which is considered a combination of solid solution strengthening and chemical short-range order strengthening. Finally, the specific yield strength of TixAly LHEAs is at least 40% higher than current developed HEAs with the same deformability level (tensile ductility over 25%). Our results bring new insights into the phase stability and precipitation suppression of HEAs, which is constructive for the development of novel lightweight alloy with outstanding mechanical properties."
