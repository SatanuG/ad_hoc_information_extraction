Hardness values were obtained by averaging four indents at an equivalent radial position, the standard deviation is indicated by the error bars (Fig.  1b ). The coarse-grained, as-received material has a hardness of 309 \u00b1 6 HV1. The hardness increases with increasing strain up to about 419.4 \u00b1 2.5 HV1 for g ~40, for higher shear strains a plateau is reached."
