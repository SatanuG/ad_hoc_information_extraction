        "evidence": "The MoNbFeVTi alloy consists of three distinct phases with the chemical composition given in Table  4 . This alloy also exhibits a dendritic microstructure. Elemental mappings, as shown in Fig.  6d-h , indicate that the bright dendrites are enriched with Mo and Nb, but depleted of Fe, V, and Ti. The gray phase in the interdendritic regions is rich in Fe, V, and Ti. Then it is seen that the minor dark phase (denoted as Ti-rich phase in Fig.  6b ) is heavily enriched with Fe and Ti. The volume fractions of the dominant bright dendrites, the (Fe, V, Ti)-rich gray phase, and the minority dark (Fe, Ti)-rich phase are about 60.6%, 38.1%, and 1.3%, respectively. It is noted that two phases are identified through the XRD pattern of the MoNbFeVTi alloy (Fig.  1c ), and the lattice parameter of the BCC phase is calculated to be 315.43 pm which is close to the lattice parameter of Mo (314.70 pm)  [44] , whereas the lattice parameter of the B2 phase is 284.74 pm that is close to the lattice parameter of Fe (288.65 pm)  [44] . Moreover, chemical compositions as shown in Table  4  show that the bright dendrite is enriched with Mo and Nb, while the gray phase is densely rich in Fe. Furthermore, both the calculated equilibrium phase diagram (Fig.  7a ) and the NE solidification simulation (Fig.  7b ) results demonstrate that the dominant phases formed in the MoNbFeVTi alloy are the A2 and B2 phase. The equilibrium phase diagram predicts that the A2 phase starts to form at 1966 \u00b0C and the B2 phase forms at T \u2264 1194 \u00b0C, as indicated in Fig.  7a . The solidus temperature is predicted to be 1163 \u00b0C. The fractions of the A2 phase and the B2 phase almost remain constant at T \u2264 1000 \u00b0C. The specific mole fractions at 600 \u00b0C are  Also, one Laves phase and one Sigma phase start to form at T = 1078 \u00b0C that is very close to the solidus temperature (1068 \u00b0C) at which the solidification is complete. After the solidification process, the mole fractions of the A2 phase and the B2 phase are predicted to be 62.4% and 30.8%, respectively. Therefore, based on the experimental results and the CALPHAD modeling, it is concluded that the bright dendrite is the A2 phase and the gray phase is the B2 phase. It is unlikely to identify the crystal structure of the dark Ti-rich phase by XRD since the volume fraction is less than 5%. The Fe-Ti binary phase diagram  [44]  shows that the B2 phase is likely to form when the ratio between Fe and Ti is close to 1:1. The chemical composition analysis (Table  4 ) reveals that the ratio between Fe   and Ti in the Ti-rich phase is very close to 1:1, which indicates that the Ti-rich phase in this alloy may also have an ordered BCC (B2) structure."
