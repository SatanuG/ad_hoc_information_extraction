        "evidence": "The evolution of the equilibrium phase mole fractions upon cooling for the HfNbTaTiV alloy was calculated, as shown in Fig.  2    \n 4(c) shows elemental distribution maps determined by 3D atomic probe tomography (APT) technique. A grain boundary runs in the lower part of the region, which can be identified by the segregations of Si and B interstitial impurities (results not shown here). From Fig.  4 (c), we can see that there was no segregation of any of the five elements at this scale and the grain boundary is totally unrecognizable in these maps, confirming the perfect high entropy mixing of them. \n Mechanical properties Fig.  5  shows the mechanical behavior of the two alloys at different temperatures. radiation and are used for the nuclear reactor applications, including Ti-6Al-4V  [34] , V-4Cr-4Ti  [35] , an oxide dispersion strengthened steel (ODS-steel)  [36] , and a martensitic steel (CLAM)  [37] . Some of the alloys are refractory HEAs similar to the V-alloy and Zr-alloy and are selected for comparison based on the criterion of having adequate ductility of >10% at room temperature, including HfNbTiVZrSi 0.5  [38] , Al 0.5 CrNbTi 2 V 0.5  [39] , and V 2 TiNbZr  [40] . In comparison with the refractory HEAs (the solid curves), the V-alloy has the slowest rate of yield strength reduction with increasing temperatures. In comparison with the low activation alloys for nuclear reactor applications (the dash curves), the V-alloy has the highest strength, indicating the V-alloy is very promising used in nuclear reactors and ultra-supercritical power generation. J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f \n Lattice distortion and solid state strengthening As presented above, the as-cast HfNbTaTiV alloy is in single phase and contains no second phase inclusions or precipitates for strengthening. To further identify the dominant strengthening mechanism against yielding, the microstructure of the alloy after deformation was also examined. Fig.  6  shows the X-ray diffraction pattern and a TEM micrograph of the alloy after deformation to 45% compression. It is evident that the alloy remained in single BCC phase without any phased transformation (Fig.  6(a) ). TEM examination also confirmed that there was no deformation twins within the structure. Dislocation slip dominates the severe deformation process (Fig.  6(b) ). Hence, the superior mechanical performance of the HfNbTaTiV alloy is attributed to the high solid solution strengthening caused by high lattice distortions in its matrix, as per the design strategy. To verify this hypothesis, the lattice distortions in the V-alloy and Zr-alloy were analyzed, as presented in Fig.  7 . The V-alloy showed a larger interatomic distance fluctuation of 0.2494\u00b10.0116 nm, comparing to 0.2438\u00b10.0058 nm for the Zr-alloy. The large variation of the interatomic distance reflects severe lattice distortion, which is not surprising given that this alloy contains elements of relatively larger differences in atomic radius (Table  2 ). Fig.  7 (e) and (f) shows HAADF-STEM images of the two alloys at a lower magnification, and the corresponding mappings of the lattice strains along [1 \u0305 21 \u0305 ] determined by using Peak Pairs Algorithm (PPA), as shown in Fig.  7 (g) and (h). It is evident that the V-alloy had a less homogeneous J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f distribution of lattice stains than the Zr-alloy. It is easy to understand that large lattice distortions impose more friction resistance to dislocation movement  [56] [57] [58] . We also calculated the solid solution strengthening effect in the V-alloy. It is estimated based on the elastic interactions between the stress fields of local lattice distortions and dislocations  [59] [60] . The interaction force (F) can be calculated as: \ud835\udc39 = \ud835\udc3a \ud835\udc4f 2 \ud835\udc53 ( 4 ) where G is the shear modulus of the alloy, b is the Burgers vector and f is the mismatch parameter, which originates from atomic size misfit and modulus misfit between the solute and solvent atoms. In a HEA, every element can be considered a solute in the rest of the alloy. Therefore, the mismatch parameter needs to be considered for every element against every other element. In a solid solution, the increment of the yield strength caused by the solid solution strengthening effect, \u2206\ud835\udf0e, can be expressed as  [61] : \u2206\u03c3\ud835\udc4f 2 = \ud835\udc4d\ud835\udc39 4 3 \u2044 \ud835\udc50 \ud835\udc56 2 3 \u2044 \ud835\udc38 \ud835\udc59 -1 3 \u2044 ( 5 ) where Z is a dimensionless material constant, \ud835\udc50 \ud835\udc56 is the molar concentration of the solute element i, and \ud835\udc38 \ud835\udc59 is the dislocation line tension, which is usually defined as \ud835\udc38 \ud835\udc59 = \ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc4f 2 /2. Substituting Eq. (  4 ) into Eq. (  5 ), the effect of solid solution strengthening caused by solute element i of concentration \ud835\udc50 \ud835\udc56 is expressed as: \ufffd"
