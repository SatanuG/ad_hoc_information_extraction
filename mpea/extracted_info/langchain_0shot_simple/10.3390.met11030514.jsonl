Precipitation of BCC2 (Nb,Ta)-rich solid solution phase, HCP (Zr,Al)-rich intermetallic phase, and ordered B2 phase can occur during heat treatment at 600~1200 \u2022 C. The precipitation of BCC2 phase mainly exists in RHEAs with low content of Al, while HCP (Hexagonal Close Packed) precipitates prefer to form in RHEAs with high content of Al. Interestingly, ordered B2 precipitates with fine and basket-weave structure can form in TiNbTa 0.5 ZrAl 0.5 alloy after annealing at 800 \u2022 C, producing significant precipitation hardening effect."

        "evidence": "The above empirical parameters for the current TiNbTa 0.5 ZrAl x RHEAs were calculated and shown in Figure  7 . The \u03b4 increases with increasing Al content and reaches the maximum value at x = 0.75. Noted that all the values of \u03b4 are below 6.6%, indicating the atomic size mismatch has limited effect on the precipitation behavior. The \u2206H mix decreases with increasing Al content and reaches the threshold value for intermetallic phase at x = 0.75, which means that an excess addition of Al can lead to the formation of intermetallic phase. The phase equilibrium based on the calculation of enthalpy of mixing agrees well with the experimental results, demonstrating that the precipitation of HCP Zr 5 Al 4 type intermetallic phase may be primarily induced by enthalpy effect. The values of \u2206H mix for atomic pairs between elements in Ti-Nb-Ta-Zr-Al system are given in Table 1  [14] . Obviously, the \u2206H mix between refractory elements is positive, but Al has large negative \u2206H mix with other refractory elements, especially with Zr, therefore, leading to the formation of Zr-Al intermetallic phase. Figure  7c  exhibits the trend of parameter \u2126 with Al content increasing. When the Al content is low, the value of \u2126 is high, which means that the entropy effect takes the dominant control of phase transformation in the RHEAs. According to the basic relation, \u2206G mix = \u2206H mix -T\u2206S mix , such phase transformation behavior is temperature-dependent. Specifically, when at high temperature, the high entropy can lead to low \u2206G mix , thus stabilizing solid solution phase, but at low temperature, the high entropy has limited stabilizing effect, and therefore, phase decomposition may occur. The precipitation of BCC2 phase in RHEA-Al0 and RHEA-Al0.2 after annealing at 600~800 \u2022 C could be explained by the weakened stabilizing effect of high entropy. Figure  7d  presents the VEC values of the Al-containing RHEAs, and all values are below 6.87. According to the empirical criterion, the calculated results indicate a BCC structure"
