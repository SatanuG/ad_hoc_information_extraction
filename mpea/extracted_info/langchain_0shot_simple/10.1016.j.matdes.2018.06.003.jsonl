        "evidence": "NbTaTi-Containing Alloys (Family 1) The NbTaTi-containing alloys were all single-phase BCC in the as-cast condition. This can be seen in the XRD patterns displayed in Fig.  1 . The microstructures in the as-cast condition were also similar. The top and bottoms of the arc-melted buttons displayed distinct microstructural regions, as shown in Fig.  2a . While the two regions are both BCC, they differ in their degree of homogeneity; the top regions show equiaxed grains composed of cored dendritic structures, whereas the bottom regions are homogeneous in composition and exhibit an equiaxed microstructure (Fig.  2b ). The reason for this microstructural difference is due to the nature of the arc-melting. When the top of the button is being melted, the bottom surface in contact with the copper hearth is not melted, which results in a large thermal gradient across the sample. Since the bottom of the button is below the melting point of the alloy, it remains solid, but undergoes some homogenization as the top is melted. The microstructures of the bottom of the buttons were not fully homogenized for all of the alloys. As shown in Figs.  2b  and 2c , the AlNbTaTi alloy"
