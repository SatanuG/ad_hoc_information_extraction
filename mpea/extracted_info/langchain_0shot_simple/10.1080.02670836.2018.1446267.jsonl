The as-cast HEA exhibits a single-phase ordered body-centred cubic (B2) structure. A hexagonal Zr 5 Al 3 -type second phase is introduced into the HEA through homogenisation treatment, resulting in increase of the yield strength, ultimate compressive strength and fracture strain by 70 MPa, 308 MPa and 9.2%, respectively."

Meanwhile, the as-cast sample shows a high ultimate compressive strength of \u223c 1554 MPa at the strain of \u223c 7.3%, and the fracture occurs when the strain reaches 8.6%. After the homogenisation treatment, the fracture strain and ultimate compressive strength increase by 9.2% and 308 MPa, respectively. The measured density of the AlNbTiZr HEA was found to be \u223c 5.85 g cm -3 , higher than the theoretical density of 5.69 g cm -3 predicted by the rule of mixtures. The measured Vickers microhardness values are 422 \u00b1 15 HV and 418 \u00b1 15 HV for the as-cast and homogenised states, respectively."

(4) The Zr 5 Al 3 -type second phase has a significant strengthening effect on the B2 AlNbTiZr HEA, showing a strength-ductility combination superior to those of other HEAs."
