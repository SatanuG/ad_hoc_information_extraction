The phase formation and elemental segregation are predicted using the CALPHAD method. The effects of Al on microstructures, and mechnical properties of AlxMoNbTaTiV are investigated, which verified the results of calculated dendritic microstructure and BCC structure. The strengthening mechanism is proved as the result of chemical and electrical interactions. The serration behavior in the compression test at 25 \ufffd C, 500 \ufffd C, 700 \ufffd C, 900 \ufffd C is discussed. At room temperature, addition of Al enhanced the dynamic aging effects in low concentration. The effects became weaker with the increase of Al content. At 500 \ufffd C, higher Al concentration leads to stronger serrated flow."

        "evidence": "For AlxMoNbTaTiV alloys, the Al atoms can be regarded as the only solute. From Table  2 , we can find the values of mixing enthalpy between five basic elements, Mo, Nb, Ta, Ti, V are in the range from \u00c0 6 kJ/mol to 5 kJ/mol, which can be defined as chemical similar elements. But the mixing enthalpy between Al and five basic elements are much larger than this, based on aforementioned discussion, the elastic interaction and modulus interaction will probably lose the dominant position, the similar results were reported by Qiu et al  [40] . The addition of Al causes a decrease in the lattice constant, the empirical parameters, \u03b4r and \u03b3. It is known from mixed enthalpy that Al exhibit strong bonding with the other five elements, even intermetallic compounds may form. The strong chemical bonding decreases the distance of atoms. Thus, the real radius of Al would be a value between covalent radius, 126 p.m., and metallic radius, 143 p.m. For chemical interaction, the p-d hybrid orbital bonding between hybridization of p state of Al and d state of transition metal is much stronger than dd metallic bonding between refractory atoms. After the addition of Al, the interlayer spacing decreases and the stacking fault energy increases, suggesting that the strength is increased and the ductility is lowered. Hence the empirical parameters and Senkov's theoretical results doesn't work in Al-containing HEAs. The chemical and electrical interactions instead of elastic or modulus interactions are main SSH mechanisms."
