The hardness of the RHEAs shows similar linear increment as a function of x, as evidenced in Fig.  6(b) . Moreover, if the unit of hardness is converted to MPa, it can be found that the hardness of the series alloys approximately triples their yield strength. And the average ratio of hardness to strength is \u03c6 = HV/\u03c3 y = 3.16. it is close to the value of \u03c6 \u2248 3, which is the common proportional relationship for pure metals and commercial alloys  [44] . The compressive fracture strain (\u03b5 f ) remains over 50% when x \u2264 0.5, however, it dramatically decreases to 31.5% and 15.1% in the Al0.75 and Al1 alloys, respectively. In addition, the series of Al-modified RHEAs show much higher specific yield strength (SYS) when compared with other reported RHEAs due to the sharp decrease of density from 6.68 g/cm 3 to 6.07 g/cm 3 as the addition of light-weight element Al."

With the addition of Al element, the width of the primary and secondary dendritic arms is all decreased, leading to the reduced dislocation free path. This will certainly yield additional strengthening effect according to the Hall-Petch relationship: \u03c3 y = \u03c3 0 + kd -0.5 . where \u03c3 y is the yield strength, d is grain size and here can be estimated by the average width of the dendritic arms, \u03c3 0 is a constant that can be considered as the lattice friction resistance, k is a constant related to the material of the alloys and can be referred as"

        "evidence": "In this work, the antioxidant light-weight element Al was added into the Ti 2 ZrHf 0.5 VNb 0.5 Al x RHEAs to improve the mechanical and oxidation properties, with main conclusions can be drawn as following: 1. Al plays a key role in the B2 ordering in the series of RHEAs. The addition of Al triggers the phase transformation in the Ti 2 ZrHf 0.5 VNb 0.5 Al x RHEAs from disordered BCC phase to ordered B2 phase without apparent long-range elemental diffusion. With the increase of Al content, the ordered B2 phase appears in the Al0.5 alloy in a very small range of short-range order, then expand to a large range of long-range order, and finally a single-phase B2 structure when x = 1. Three semi-empirical criteria are used to predict this phase formation, and we found that the B2 ordering starts when \u0394H mix < -14 kJ\u22c5mol -1 , Bo < 0.4Md+1.9. In this paper, the process of transformation from single BCC structure to single B2 structure has been studied in depth. The results not only provide experience for the design of RHEAs with B2 phase in the future, but also shed lights on the potential of structural application at elevated temperature for these RHEAs."
