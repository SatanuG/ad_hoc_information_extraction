The obtained HfMo x NbTaTiZr alloys show excellent room-temperature plasticity. The studied alloys, except for the Mo-1 alloy, underwent a 50% compression strain without any evidence of fracture. The HfMo x NbTaTiZr c 2921 \uf03d \uf044\uf073alloys can be considered as quasi-binary alloys, and a linear correlation between their yield strength and a solute atom concentration is established."
