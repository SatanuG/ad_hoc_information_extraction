        "evidence": "In this work, Ti-Zr-Nb-V alloys with different V/Zr ratios were prepared by vacuum arc melting. While most of the alloys, and particularly those with a low V/Zr ratio, are SSSs with the BCC structure, the non-negligible V-Zr interaction leads to the presence of V 2 Zr (Laves phase) precipitates in the V30 and V35 alloys. The Laves phase precipitates ahead of the advancing solid-liquid interface during the solidification of the alloy and inhibits the generation of the directional crystallized dendritic morphology. When the lattice distortions of different alloys were designed to remain stable, an increasing V/Zr ratio results in an increase in the VEC and a decrease in the lattice constant. The increase in the VEC per lattice volume enhances the Coulombic interaction between the free electrons and the ion cores, leading to the increased binding energy of the metallic bond. Excluding the contributions of other strengthening effects and based on the Coulombic force model, a semi-quantitative formula = + VEC R 437 100\u2022( ) \u2022 y n 2 1 relating the intrinsic yield strength of Ti-Zr-Nb-V alloys to the VEC and average atomic radius in the lattice is proposed. This formula shows good accuracy in the description of the intrinsic yield strength of Ti-Zr-Nb-V RHEAs and other RHEAs."
