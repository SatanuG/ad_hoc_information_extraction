        "evidence": "V1.0 alloy in this study is represented by the red dot symbol. It can be seen that the yield strength of V1.0 at RT (1256 MPa) is not outstanding compared with other RHEAs. However, as the temperature increases, the yield stress of V1.0 exceeds those of most other RHEAs, indicating that V1.0 alloy has stronger resistance to high-temperature softening compared with other RHEAs. At 10 0 0 \u00b0C, the yield strength of V1.0 (811 MPa) is only lower than four RHEAs (in the blue rectangle), i.e. MoNbTaVW  [7]  , HfMoTaTiZr  [13]  , HfMoNbTaZr  [44]  , and AlMo 0.5 NbTa 0.5 TiZr 0.5  [45]  . Nevertheless, Fig.  4  (b) (at the upper right corner of (a)) shows that V1.0 alloy has the RT fracture strain > 25% that is superior to other four RHEAs, especially MoNbTaVW and AlMo 0.5 NbTa 0.5 TiZr 0.5 (fracture strains ~2%), indicating V1.0 possesses much better RT ductility/workability. Fig.  4 (c ) further compares the stress-strain curves of the five alloys at 10 0 0 \u00b0C. MoNbTaVW exhibits the highest yield stress and flow stress but much lower ductility. AlMo 0.5 NbTa 0.5 TiZr 0.5 , HfMoTaTiZr, and Hf-MoNbTaZr show high yield strength and good ductility but exhibit significant strain-softening after yielding (or as increasing the strain), which is obviously inferior compared with V1.0 that features the ultimate strength as high as ~1.4 GPa and no strain softening."
