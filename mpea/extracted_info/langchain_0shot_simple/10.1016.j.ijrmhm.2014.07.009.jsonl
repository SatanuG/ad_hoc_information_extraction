At room temperature, the \u03c3 y of Ti 20 Zr 20 Hf 20 Nb 20 Cr 20 is relatively large, compared to the available values of refractory HEAs (1058 MPa for TaNbWMo and 1246 MPa for TaNbWMoV  [3] ). Table  3  shows the Vickers hardness HV 0.1 of Ti 20 Zr 20 Hf 20 Nb 20 X 20 (X = V, Cr) alloys as a function of the annealing temperature. The  Figs.  5(a, b, c ) and 6(a, b, c) are about the samples of the Ti 20 Zr 20 Hf 20 Nb 20 V 20 alloy before and after annealing at 1173 K. The alloy was deformed to 30% compression strain without fracture which can be seen in Fig.  5 (b) while after annealing at 1173 K some cracks appear in Fig.  6(b) . That is confirming good plasticity of this material in as cast state. Figs.  5(c ) and 6(c) show the deformed grains of these samples that were elongated in the radial direction. The fracture surface corresponds to ductile inter-crystalline fracture when propagation of the crack took place through the grain body. The ductile fracture leads to the formation of dimples of different sizes and morphology, while the brittle fracture occurs by quasicleavage of the Laves phases. The brittle nature of the Laves phases leads to low ductility of the samples. A wide range of the mechanical properties is attainable through different combinations of these two phases: BCC phase as a relatively soft and ductile one while FCC phase (Laves phases) as hard but brittle phases. In Vegard's law discussed above is often used to estimate the lattice parameter a mix phase of alloys. Our ab initio predications are slightly larger than a mix for the three refractory HEAs. Hence all alloys show a small but systematic positive deviation relative to Vegard's rule. We note that for all HEAs considered here, the calculated lattice parameter a t is slightly larger than the experiments a e , except for Ti 20 Zr 20 Hf 20 Nb 20 Cr 20 . It is very likely that this deviation is due to the employed frozen-core approximation, which is known to yield somewhat larger lattice parameters as compared to all-electron calculations. All HEAs considered here are predicted to be mechanically stable according to the dynamical stability conditions c 44 N 0, c 11 N |c 12 | and c 11 + 2c 12 N 0. For the Ti 20 Zr 20 Hf 20 Nb 20 X 20 (X = V, Cr, Ta) refractory HEAs, the polycrystalline elastic moduli are very similar. It is found that V has a small effect on B, G and E of Ta 25 Nb 25 W 25 Mo 25 alloys. According to Tables  3  and 4   Room-temperature compressive mechanical properties for Ti 20 Zr 20 Hf 20 Nb 20 X (X = V, Cr) as-cast and heat-treated alloys, namely Young's modulus (E), yield stress (\u03c3 y ), fracture strength (\u03c3 max ), plastic strain (\u03b5 p ) and Vickers hardness at 1 N load (HV 0.1 ).     The Ti 20 Zr 20 Hf 20 Nb 20 X 20 (X = V or Cr) alloys show a large elastic and plastic strain limits while the BCC phase is stable against heating for 600 s up to 1173 K. "
