The non-equilibrium solidification simulation was accomplished using the Scheil-Gulliver models [35, 36] , which assume equilibrium mixing in the liquid with no diffusion in the solid. The simulation also predicts the formation of a single BCC solid solution phase as shown in Figure 5b . Simulation on the true bulk composition reveals very similar results; that is, only the BCC phase forms as the primary crystallization phase under both solidification routes, and it is stable over a very wide temperature range."

        "evidence": "Mechanical Properties Figure  7a  shows the engineering stress-strain curves (RT, 23 \u00b0C) for MoNbTaV alloy. The yield stress (i.e., \u03c3 0.2 is defined as the stress at strain \u03b5 = 0.2%.) of MoNbTaV is 1.5 GPa, while the maximum compressive fracture strength is 2.4 GPa. The alloy exhibits about 21% compression strain before fracture and a large work-hardening capacity. Both the strength and the ductility of MoNbTaV are significantly greater than MoNbTaW (\u03c3 0.2 = 1.0 GPa with compression strain \u03b5 = 2.1%)  [22] . While the higher ductility of MoNbTaV alloy is expected, its higher yield strength is a surprise. One factor that may contribute to its higher strength could be its much refined grain sizes in the as-cast state than the homogenized MoNbTaW alloy  [22] . The MoNbTaW sample was annealed at 1400 \u00b0C for 19 h, leading to an average grain size about 200 \u03bcm  [22] . Also, the presence of pores could be seen in both intergranular and intragranular areas in MoNbTaW  [22] . As shown in the Figure  7b , the morphology of the fractograph exhibits a mixture of cleavage steps, river patterns, and tongue patterns in MoNbTaV. For a meaningful evaluation on MoNbTaV for high temperature applications, proper homogenization and subsequent measurement of its yield strength and fracture strength during tensile/compression tests as a function of temperature are required. This task is beyond the scope of the present study."
