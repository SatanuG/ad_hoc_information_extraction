Due to a more noticeable strain hardening at the beginning of deformation, the flow stress of the cast sample was about 60-100 MPa higher than the SC and WQ samples at true strains higher  than 0.15. The alloy in these three conditions was very ductile showing no evidence of cracking during RT deformation. The alloy sample, which was additionally annealed at 600 \u00b0C, was stronger than three other conditions, having \ud835\udf0e y = 1173 MPa and more noticeable strain hardening. However, this sample approached the maximum true stress of 1418 MPa at the true strain \ud835\udf00 = 0.14 and fractured at \ud835\udf00 f = 0.27 (see Fig.  2 a )."

The element microsegregation observed in the Cast condition in the form of the dendritic structure has a very weak effect on the yield stress, although it slightly increases the strain hardening rate after yielding. On the other hand, the multi-phase structure produced after annealing at 600 \u00b0C (LTA condition, Fig.  1 d ) has noticeably higher yield stress and strain hardening rate. This indicates that, in the studied alloy, precipitation strengthening from secondary (ordered) phases is more effective than the strengthening from the concentration fluctuations and partial ordering inside the BCC solid solution phase. The mechanical behavior of the partially ordered cubic matrix appears quite similar to that of ductile single-phase BCC solid solution RCCAs: high yield stress, low strain-hardening and good compressive ductility  [2 , 20 , 21]  . The attractive yield strength can be explained by the compounding effects of a solid solution strengthening and the presence of ordered regions with possible pinning effects on dislocations (see Fig.  1 c ), while good ductility can be explained by the continuous nature of the disordered BCC phase  [14]  . A reduced ductility of the multi-phase LTA condition at 23 \u00b0C is likely due to the brittle nature of precipitated phases. The observation of shear/dislocation bands after deformation at RT and 400 \u00b0C ( Fig.  6 a, b, d ) attests that the deformation mechanisms operate with the same signature. Moreover, the presence of a composite microstructure made of hard and soft zones (i.e. associated with a high and low dislocation density) could act as long range obstacles for mobile dislocations, leading to an increase in internal stresses and finally to strain hardening (see Fig.  2 a )  [22]  .
