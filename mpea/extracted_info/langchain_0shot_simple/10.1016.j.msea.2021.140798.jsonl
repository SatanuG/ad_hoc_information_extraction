The results revealed that the proportion and stability of prior BCC and phase transformation ratio of BCC during deformation are strongly dependent on the amount of Nb. Decreasing the Nb content reduces the BCC phase stability and promotes the martensitic transformation from BCC to HCP upon loading. Moreover, additional mechanical twinning in the product HCP phase was also activated due probably to the lower SFE resulted from the Nb addition, giving rise to an enhanced sustained strain hardening rate and thus a superior combination of strength (983 MPa) and uniform ductility (>26%), which surmounts the level of most BCC refractory HEAs reported previously."
