<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In the study of high-entropy alloys (HEAs), due to the enormous adjustment space of the content (5-35 at.%) of each principal element, the yield strength at room temperature (RT) of the alloys are basically difficult to estimate. Five kinds of Nb-Mo-Ta-W HEAs with the same component elements but in different contents were fabricated by vacuum arc melting (VAM). The crystal structures of five kinds of alloys are all single-phase solid solutions of BCC structure. The grain sizes of each alloy are about ~150 μm and the substructures within the grain are typical dendritic. The calculated yield strength through solid solution strengthening (SSS) model by Senkov is in certain agreement with the experimental yield strength of five alloys. In our study, the concept of configurational entropy is brought in to optimize the model. In comparison with the calculated yield strength of original model, the variation trend curve of the optimized model was in better agreement with that in experiment. Moreover, the optimized SSS model has a certain universality to predict the mechanical properties in other refractory HEAs system with a single BCC structure composed of W, Nb, Mo, Ta, Zr, Hf, Ti, V element.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>In recent years, the appearance of high entropy alloys (HEAs) with multiple principal elements has broken through the traditional alloy design concept and its outstanding properties <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> have attracted extensive attention. In terms of the definition of HEAs, in 2004, Yeh et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> defined HEAs as alloys with five or more principal elements and each principal element should have a concentration between 5 and 35 at.%.</p><p>Currently, HEAs can be divided into two types according to their chemical composition: <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> HEAs with equalatomic ratio, such as NbMoTaWV <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, CoCrFeMnNi <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> and AlCoCrFeNi <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> HEAs with non-equalatomic ratio, such as CoCrFeMnNiV x (x = 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1) <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, Al x CoCrFeNi (x = 0-2.0) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Non-equiatomic ratio HEA generally regulates the mechanical properties by changing the mole proportion of a certain principal element in the alloy while the other principal elements occupying the rest of contents in equal mole ratios. However, the adjustment space of the composition content of each principle element is enormous (5-35 at.%). When the content of each principle element in HEAs varies greatly, the mechanical properties of the alloys are basically difficult to estimate. Therefore, a scientific theory is needed to predict the mechanical properties of HEAs with the same component elements but in different contents.</p><p>There are many approaches of strengthening mechanisms for predicting the room temperature (RT) mechanical properties of HEAs <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>:</p><p>The lattice distortion effect is considered as an essential factor that affects the mechanical properties. The severe lattice distortion comes from different kinds of elements with different atom sizes. In several previous studies, Nguyen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> consider the strength of Ti-Zr-Nb-Ta alloy system positively correlates with the atomic radius difference. The same conclusion can also be obtained in Nb-Mo-Cr-Ti-Al HEAs system <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. As shear modulus do not change significantly with compositions, this approach mainly considers the atomic size difference of the composed elements.</p><p>Another approach to model solid solution strengthening (SSS) in HEAs was proposed by Senkov et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> and applied to HfNbTaTiZr HEA. In this model, the rule of mixture mechanical property, atomic size difference and shear modulus difference are associated comprehensively. The model mainly relies on the traditional SSS of binary solid solution (SS) systems proposed by Labush <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. In the absence of considering thermally-activated processes, the calculated result is in good agreement with the experimental result. After that, Yao et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> used the model and calculated RT yield strength and Vikers hardness for 14 equiatomic refractory HEAs. The calculated results are in satisfactory agreement with the experimental results. Although both the selection of certain parameters, constants and some details of the mathematical calculation are slightly different, the theoretically calculated yield strength of a series of refractory HEAs and medium-entropy alloys (MEAs) for TaNbHfZrTi <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, (TiZrNbTa)-Mo <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, NbTaTiV <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, NbMoTa <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> is in good agreement with the experimental yield strength through this model.</p><p>Coury et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> modeled the yield strength of single-phase BCC refractory HEAs through the summation of athermal solid-solution strengthening component and thermally-activated yield stress component. The thermally-activated yield stress contributes an essential role in the high yield strengths of HEAs at RT.</p><p>There are other models that consider calculating the yield stress at any given temperature through the critical resolved shear stress (CRSS).</p><p>The main research about the CRSS are dislocations type. Maresca and Curtin <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> proposed a general theory of strengthening of screw dislocations in a broad class of BCC random HEAs. Later, they <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> found the strengthening of Mo-Nb-Ta-V-W refractory HEAs systems may be controlled by edge dislocations over a wide temperature range. Rao et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> modeled the dislocation behavior in a randomly-distributed model-BCC Co 16.67 Fe 36.67 Ni 16.67 Ti 30 alloy. The CRSS in true random alloy required to move the equilibrium a/2〈111〉 screw dislocation is much larger than in a "mean-field" version of the same alloy composition. In addition, Rao et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> studies the large scale, atomistic simulations of the core structure and mobility of ½[111] screw, edge and mixed dislocations in ternary NbTiZr, Nb 1.5 TiZr 0.5 and Nb 0.5 TiZr 1.5 multicomponent alloys. In their work, small amounts of interstitials can have a significant impact on the yield strength and of refractory HEAs.</p><p>The Nb-Mo-Ta-W HEAs system was selected to predict the conventional mechanical properties (Vickers microhardness and yield   strength) at RT due to its unique characteristics. In 2010, Senkov et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref> obtain the equiatomic ratio NbMoTaW and VNbMoTaW refractory HEAs with a simple single-phase BCC structure for the first time through vacuum arc melting (VAM) process. The melting point of NbMoTaW alloy is higher than 2500 °C, and the yield strength is 405 MPa at 1600 °C. In 2015, Zou et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> found that the yield strength of NbMoTaW HEA at the nanometer size exceeded 10 GPa, and the compressive strain could reach more than 30%. The compressive yield strength was the highest among all the reported micro/nano metal materials. In 2020, Moorehead et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> tested 31 kinds of Nb-Mo-Ta-W HEAs with different chemical compositions and found that all HEAs showed the single-phase BCC structure. Compared to the multi-phase refractory HEAs, the single phase HEAs remains high strength with increasing temperature above 1000 °C <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</p><p>In this study, five kinds of Nb-Mo-Ta-W HEAs with the same component elements but in different contents were designed and then formed by the VAM process. The microstructure and mechanical properties at RT were characterized and tested. In the absence of considering thermally-activated processes, we substitute the concept of  configurational entropy into the SSS model by Senkov. In comparison with the calculated yield strength at RT of the original model, the variation trend curve of the optimized yield strength was in better agreement with that in experiment, which provided a theoretical basis for the design of chemical contents of BCC structural refractory HEAs systems.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussions</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Lattice distortion effect model</head><p>As one of the four 'core effects' of HEAs, the lattice distortion effect is considered as an essential factor that affects the mechanical properties. In pure metals, the lattice is standard, shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5-(a)</ref>. In one principal element alloys, the lattice site is mainly occupied by the principal element, and there is a certain degree of lattice distortion, shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5-(b</ref>). However, for HEAs, in the case of ignoring the chemical short-range ordering, each element has the same probability to occupy each lattice site, causing severe lattice distortion, shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5-(c)</ref>. This effect can be described directly related to differences in atomic size (δ r ), by the following equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">= = = = c r r r c r 100 (1 / ) ; r i n i i i n i i 1 2 1 (1)</formula><p>where c i, i are the atomic fractions and atom radii of the i-th elements respectively. Through this equation, it can be recognized the atomic radius difference of the HEA is positively correlated with the degree of lattice distortion.</p><p>The relation between the experimental yield strength (YS) at RT, Vikers microhardness (Hv) and lattice distortion degree is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>. According to the experimental mechanical properties of five kinds of Nb-Mo-Ta-W HEAs in section 3.2, it can be concluded that there is no obvious mathematical rule for the lattice distortion degree on the mechanical properties of five alloys due to the significant change of the ROM shear modulus of alloys.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Solid solution strengthening model by Senkov</head><p>SSS can be regarded from the elastic interaction between the local stress field of a solute atom and those of dislocation. There are mainly two kinds of approach: Fleisher's approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> and Labush's approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Currently, Labush's approach is widely used to predict yield strength in HEAs <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>.</p><p>The value for SSS Δσ i can be obtained:   </p><formula xml:id="formula_1">= AG c i i i 4/3 2/3 (2)</formula><p>where A is a fitting material-dependent dimensionless constant, c i is the i solute concentration, and δ i is the mismatch parameter determined by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">= + = + [ ] ( ) i Gi ai Gi ai 2 2 2 1/2</formula><p>(3)</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">= + = = dG dc G da dc a 1 | |/2 ; 1 ; 1 Gi Gi Gi Gi i ai i (4)</formula><p>here δ Gi ' represents the elastic misfit while ai represents the atomic size misfit. β is a parameter, which value depends on the type of mobile dislocation.

For a type of mobile dislocation, Maresca and Curtin <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> found the strengthening of Nb-Mo-Ta-W refractory HEAs systems may be controlled by edge dislocations over a wide temperature range. The similar conclusions are also proposed by Wang and Xu <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, Toda-caraballo and Rivera-Díaz-Del-Castillo <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. There the β is assumed to be 16.</p><p>In HEAs BCC solid solutions. The atomic size and modulus mismatches between atoms cause the local lattice distortion. The δ ai and δ Gi in the vicinity of an element i can be estimated as an average of the atomic size difference and atomic modulus difference:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">= c 8 ai j aij (5) = c 9 8 Gi j Gij (6)</formula><p>where c j is atom fraction of j element in the alloy. δ aij = 2(r i -r j )/ (r i + r j ) is the atomic size difference of elements i and j, while</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">δ Gij = 2(G i -G j )/(G i + G j )</formula><p>is the shear modulus difference between elements i and j. The atomic radius, shear modulus and yield strength of each element are listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. The calculated parameters of δ aij , δ Gij , are presented in Table <ref type="table">5</ref>. Substitute all the calculated parameters of each element into the Eq. ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>). Then the Δσ of alloys can be expressed in the following:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">= ( ) i 3/2 2/3<label>(7)</label></formula><p>Finally, the calculated yield strength of the HEAs is equal to the sum of the rule of mixture yield strength (σ s mix ) and Δσ:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">= + s cal s mix<label>(8)</label></formula><p>According to the above equation, the calculated yield strength of the 5 kinds of alloys is shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">6</ref>. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref> shows the relationship between calculated yield strength and experimental yield strength of the alloys. It can be concluded that the calculated yield strength of the HEAs has a well correlation with the experimental yield strength. However, the experimental yield strength of alloy 3, which theoretically should have the highest calculated yield strength, is less than that of alloy 5 with equalatomic ratio, which will be discussed in section 4.3.</p></div>

Tsai and Yeh <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> stated that higher mixing entropy (mainly configurational) in HEAs lowers the free energy of solid solution phases and enhances the formation of solid solution phases. Also, this effect could increase and make the micro-structure much simpler <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>.</p><p>The high entropy effect could enhance the mutual solubility between constituent elements. In Gao et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> literature, this effect could increase the strength and ductility of solution phases due to solution hardening.

To sum up, we consider the entropy of HEAs will affect the yield strength in HEAs systems with the same component elements but in different contents.</p><p>The study of high entropy effect mainly focused on configurational entropy of ideal solutions <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. Therefore, we use the magnitude of configurational entropy to represent the entropy of the HEAs systems, shown as follows: </p><formula xml:id="formula_8">= = S R c c ln conf i n i i 1 (9)</formula><p>In the SSS model of the HEAs in section 4.2, the high entropy effect on yield strength of HEAs at RT was not taken into consideration. We add a dimensionless constant into Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_7">8</ref>) to express the influence of configurational entropy on the yield strength of HEAs at RT:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">= + S S s cal s mix conf conf max n<label>(10)</label></formula><p>where ΔS conf ' is the configurational entropy of the calculated alloy, ΔS conf max is the maximum configurational entropy with the same component elements. n is a constant and its value can be obtained in the following fitting. In Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_9">10</ref>), the magnitude of configurational entropy on yield strength at RT has been taken into consideration. When the calculated alloy the HEA with equalatomic ratio, the configurational entropy is equal to the maximum configurational entropy and the Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_9">10</ref>) is consistent with Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_7">8</ref>). The relation between the yield strength calculated by Eq.

In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref>, as the magnitude of constant n increases, the variation trend curve of calculated yield strength and experimental yield strength of five alloys comes more and more ideal than that of n = 0, shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8-(a</ref>) and (b). When n = 3, the variation trend of the calculated yield strength is in best agreement with that of experimental yield strength, shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8-(c</ref>). After that, as the magnitude of constant n continues to increase, the variation trend comes worse, shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8-(d)</ref>.</p><p>This optimized SSS model is not only feasible in the Nb-Mo-Ta-W HEAs system, but also in other BCC single structural refractory HEAs systems composed of W, Nb, Mo, Ta, Zr, Hf, Ti, V element.

At next step, the theoretical yield strength of the above BCC structural HEAs systems was statistical calculated by the model in sections 4.2 and 4.3. When n = 3, the variation trend curve of calculated yield strength by our study and experimental yield strength are in better agreement compared to the yield strength calculated with the SSS model by Senkov, shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">9</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9</ref>.</p><p>In our study, in single phase BCC structural refractory HEAs systems, the high entropy effect will affect the mechanical properties of the systems with the same component elements but in different contents due to solution hardening caused by different configurational entropy.

This conclusion provides a theoretical basis for the chemical contents design of refractory BCC structural HEAs systems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusions</head><p>Several conclusions can be drawn as follows: (a) All the five Nb-Mo-Ta-W HEAs with same component elements but in different contents fabricated by the VAM process have a single-phase solid solution of BCC structure. In five alloys, the yield strength has a certain positive correlation with the compressive strain. On chemical contents design of the Nb-Mo-Ta-W high-entropy alloy system, it is more possible to obtain alloys with better plasticity by giving priority to the prediction of the yield strength.</p><p>(b) Higher mixing entropy (mainly configurational) in HEAs lowers the free energy of solid solution phases and enhances the formation of solid solution phases. The high entropy effect could enhance the mutual solubility between constituent elements and increase the strength and ductility of solution phases due to solution hardening. In Nb-Mo-Ta-W system, different magnitude of the configurational entropy may affect the yield strength of alloys at RT. The concept of configurational entropy is brought in to optimize the SSS model by Senkov.</p><p>(c) There is no obvious mathematical rule for the lattice distortion degree on the yield strengths of five kinds of the Nb-Mo-Ta-W HEAs. In the SSS model by Senkov, the calculated yield strength is in certain agreement with the experimental yield strength at RT. However, after optimization, the variation trend curve of calculated yield strength and experimental yield strength was in better agreement. Moreover, the optimized SSS model has a certain universality to predict the yield strength at RT in other refractory HEAs system with a single BCC structure composed of W, Nb, Mo, Ta, Zr, Hf, Ti, V element.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
