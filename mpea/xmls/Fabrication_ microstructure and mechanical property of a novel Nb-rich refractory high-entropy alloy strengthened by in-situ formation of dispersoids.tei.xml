<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>We fabricated Nb 42 Mo 20 Ti 13 Cr 12 V 12 Ta 1 , a novel refractory high-entropy alloy (RHEA) enriched with niobium (Nb), by following a high-energy ball milling and spark plasma sintering (SPS) method. The microstructure of the bulk RHEA formed a single body-centered cubic (BCC) matrix with in-situ-formed carbide dispersoids. The combination of the effect of the severe deformations caused by the milling, the short sintering time, and the impedance of the grain growth caused by the dispersoids led to the formation of nano-sized grains, in spite of the high sintering temperature of 1200 °C. This resulted in outstanding mechanical properties. The bulk Nb 42 Mo 20 Ti 13 Cr 12 V 12 Ta 1 RHEA exhibits a compressive yield strength of 2680 MPa, a maximum strength of 3896 MPa, and a Vickers hardness of 741 HV. The excellent mechanical properties of the alloy can be attributed to the strengthening of the dispersion and the solid solution, coupled with the grain refinement effects.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>High-entropy alloys (HEAs) are a new class of multi-component alloys, consisting of five or more metallic elements with equiatomic or near-equiatomic ratios in the range 5-35 at.% <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. In spite of the large number of alloying elements, the HEAs can exhibit simple solid solution phases, such as face-centered cubic (FCC), body-centered cubic (BCC) or even hexagonal close-packed (HCP) phases. This is due to their high configurational entropy <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Since Yeh et al. first defined HEAs in 2004 <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>, they have attracted significant interest due to their unique composition, microstructure, and excellent properties, such as high strength with moderate ductility, thermal stability, corrosion and wear resistance, etc. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. In particular, refractory HEAs (RHEAs), which are a relatively new type of BCC-based HEA that contain refractory metals such as tungsten (W), molybdenum (Mo), tantalum (Ta), vanadium (V), niobium (Nb), etc., have been reported to have outstanding strength and hardness at both room and elevated temperatures, in comparison to Ni-based superalloys <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. These composites were proposed by Senkov in 2010 <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. They are now attracting attention as promising materials for future high-temperature applications.</p><p>Numerous methods for preparing HEAs have been reported, including melting and casting <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>, laser cladding <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref>, sputtering <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref> and powder metallurgical (PM) processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref>. To date, the majority of HEAs have been fabricated using melting and casting processes. However, there are usually problems associated with these methods, such as chemical inhomogeneity or segregation phenomena. Additional energy consuming processes, such as heat treatment, are necessary to homogenize the microstructures of the alloys <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">22]</ref>. In particular, it is much more difficult to prepare RHEAs by casting than it is to fabricate other HEAs. This is due to their extremely high melting point and the wide differences in melting temperature among RHEAs. PM processes are an alternative technique for fabricating RHEAs. In particular, recent research has focused on high-energy ball milling and subsequent powder consolidation <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref>, but this avenue of research is still in its early stages. There are several advantages to the samples fabricated by PM processes, such as their homogeneous microstructures <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref> and ultra-fine-grained structures <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28]</ref>. In addition, there are several reports that the PM routes lead to the in-situ formation of fine, homogeneous dispersoids <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">30]</ref>. These enhance the strength of the samples further via dispersion strengthening. Therefore, we may be able to enhance the mechanical properties of RHEAs by applying PM fabrication processes rather than casting processes. Furthermore, PM processes are more feasible for manufacturing small and precise RHEA components that can be used for high-temperature applications. Therefore, it is necessary to study the fabrication of RHEAs by PM processes. This may widen the range of applications of these materials. Motivated by the findings described above, we fabricated a novel RHEA composed of Nb 42 Mo 20 Ti 13 Cr 12 V 12 Ta 1 . We fabricated the novel RHEA by applying 2 PM techniques, namely high-energy ball milling and spark plasma sintering (SPS). Here, the composition of the alloy was designed to deviate from the conventional near-equiatomic RHEA systems while taking the thermodynamic definition of HEAs into consideration. Especially, we chose to enrich the RHEA with Nb due to its relatively low density (8.57 g/cm 3 ) and high melting point (2750 K). We also included strong carbide formers (Ti, V, Ta) so that carbide dispersoids would be synthesized by in-situ reactions during the processes. We used a process control agent (PCA) as the carbon source, which was required to produce the carbide. The PCA was necessary to prevent the excessive cold-welding of the powder particles and increase the powder yields <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">31]</ref>. In this study, we investigated a novel Nb 42 Mo 20 Ti 13 Cr 12 V 12 Ta 1 RHEA, strengthened by the in-situ formation of carbide during the PM procedures. We then systematically investigated the phase, microstructure and mechanical properties of the Nb 42 Mo 20 Ti 13 Cr 12 V 12 Ta 1 RHEA.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Materials and methods</head><p>We used elemental Nb, Mo, Ti, Cr, V and Ta powders with purities over 99.5% as raw materials for the Nb 42 Mo 20 Ti 13 Cr 12 V 12 Ta 1 RHEA. The elemental powders were placed into a SKD-11 bowl of tungsten carbide (WC) balls with diameters of 7 mm. The powders were milled in a planetary high-energy ball-mill (Pulverisette 5) at 200 rpm for 12 h, with a ball-to-powder ratio of 10:1. This process was undertaken in a high-purity argon atmosphere to prevent oxidation. We reduced the probability of the cold-welding of the powders and promoted the formation of carbide dispersoids by including 5 wt% N-heptane as the PCA and carbon source. The ball-milled powders were then consolidated by SPS (SPS-515S) at 1200 °C for 5 min under a pressure of 50 MPa. During the SPS, the samples were heated from room temperature to 600 °C, and from 600 °C to 1200 °C, at rates of 600 and 100 °C/min, respectively. We measured the temperature of the specimen during the SPS using an infrared pyrometer. The crystalline structure was analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD; Rigaku SmartLab) with Cu-Kα radiation. We characterized the microstructure of the specimen using scanning electron microscopy (SEM; Philips XL30) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM; JEOL JEM-ARM200F) equipped with an energy-dispersive spectrometer (EDS). The grain size of the matrix, volume fraction and average size of the in-situ carbides were measured quantitatively using image analysis software (Saramsoft ImagePartner). The Vickers hardness was determined using a micro-hardness tester (Akashi HM-124) under a load of 9.8 N with a loading time of 10 s; we report the average value of 10 measurements. We carried out the compressive test using a universal testing machine (Instron 5583) with cylindrical specimens (3 mm diameter and 4.5 mm height). The strain was measured by a customized strain gauge directly applied on the test fixtures right beside the specimens. We obtained representative values by averaging the results of three measurements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Results and discussions</head><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows the XRD patterns of the powders after milling for 12 h and the SPSed bulk specimen. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, the bulk specimen had a single BCC solid solution phase, and the minor peaks closely matched with those of TiC [JCPDS card no. 65-8805]. The spectra of the milled powders still exhibit residual peaks from each of the alloying elements. This indicates that the powders were not completely alloyed after 12 h high-energy ball milling. Nevertheless, we fabricated a completely alloyed Nb 42 Mo 20 Ti 13 Cr 12 V 12 Ta 1 RHEA specimen by undertaking the subsequent sintering process. At our previous study <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref>, we reported that stable and single BCC solid solution phase, which represented the complete alloying of each constituents, can be formed during the SPS process, even though as-milled powders had not been completely alloyed. We confirmed the evolution of the BCC solid solution phase by comparing the diffraction peaks of the milled powders with those of the bulk specimen. The residual peaks for each of the elements of the alloy disappeared after the SPS, which confirms that the elements were completely alloyed. Such phase transformation during the SPS is due to the thermodynamic drive to achieve more stable energy state. The repeated fracture and deformation of powders during the high energy milling induce large lattice strains and high concentration of defects, resulting that the as-milled powders have a nonequilibrium state <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">33]</ref>. During the SPS, reordering process by thermally activated diffusion occurred, collaborated with the annihilation of the defects induced by the severe deformation during the milling <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[32]</ref>. Notably, we identified the in-situ formation of TiC-based dispersoids during the sintering. This was caused by the introduction of carbon from the N-heptane PCA into the powders <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref>. We attributed the formation of the TiC-based dispersoids to the strong carbideforming ability of Ti. Each of the constituents of the alloy presented in this paper are transition metals whose electron configurations have a partially filled d sub-shell. In general, the affinities between the alloying elements and carbon are inversely proportional to the number of electrons in the d sub-shell <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref>. Ti has the lowest number of electrons in the d sub-shell, and therefore the strongest carbide-forming ability of all the elements in the alloy system discussed in this paper.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> shows the back-scattered electron (BSE) images of the bulk alloy and bright-field scanning-transmission electron microscopy (BF-STEM) micrograph. The low-magnification BSE image (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2(a)</ref>) shows that the Nb 42 Mo 20 Ti 13 Cr 12 V 12 Ta 1 RHEA consists of a relatively bright BCC matrix, with dark, homogeneously dispersed nano-sized dispersoids. The relative density of the alloy developed in this study, with respect to the theoretical density of 8.02 g/cm 3 , was almost 100%. As shown in the high-magnification BSE image in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2(b)</ref>, the alloy has a homogenous microstructure without dendritic structures. Chemical compositions of the 12 h milled powders and the BCC matrix after the SPS were summarized in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. Both the 12 h milled powders and the matrix after the sintering were close to nominal compositions of the present alloy. Due to the incomplete alloying after the milling, the 12 h milled powders have wider deviation of compositions than those of the matrix after the SPS. The BF-STEM image clearly illustrates the morphologies of the nano-grains, along with in-situ TiC-based dispersoids. Compared to Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2(a</ref>) and (b), we inverted the contrast of the dispersoids in the BF-STEM image. The grain size of the matrix, volume fraction, and average diameter of the dispersoids were 327 ± 131 nm, 20.3%, and 75 ± 43 nm, respectively. These values were calculated using image analysis software. Compared to the micro-scale grain size of other HEAs prepared by the conventional casting process <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">34]</ref>, the morphology of the alloy developed in this study, which we fabricated with the powder processes described above, is finer-grain. This is due to the combined effects of the severe plastic deformation induced by the high-energy milling and short period of the SPS process <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[35]</ref>. Furthermore, the grain morphology is refined by the in-situ formation of dispersoids, which impedes the grain growth <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[36]</ref>. It is worth noting that the alloy discussed in this study is more fine-grained than other SPS-processed HEAs, even though the Nb-rich HEA was sintered at a relatively high sintering temperature, of 1200 °C, in comparison to the other HEAs, which were prepared by ball milling and SPS (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>). This could be due to the impedance of the grain growth caused by the Zener pinning effect during the sintering <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">38]</ref>.</p><p>We characterized the single BCC phase microstructures, which contained in-situ TiC-based dispersoids, with high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) imaging and selected area electron diffraction (SAED). We also conducted EDS mapping analysis to reveal the distributions of the chemical constituents of the matrix and the dispersoids.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> shows a dark-field STEM image and corresponding SAED patterns of the Nb-rich HEA, along with the EDS mapping for each of the alloying elements. Compared to the BF-STEM image shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2(c</ref>), the dispersoids are presented with dark contrast and the matrix is bright, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>. The SAED pattern of the matrix is centered along the [133] plane, which represents a BCC crystal structure with a lattice parameter of 0.313 nm. The SAED pattern of the TiCbased dispersoids is centered along the [111] axis and we calculated its lattice parameter to be 0.426 nm. The crystal structures of the dispersoids were revealed to be FCC, the same as TiC. The EDS mapping clearly shows that the dispersoids were enriched with Ti. Due to limitations in the sensitivity of EDS with respect to the detection of C, we omitted C from the mapping. Nonetheless, we considered the dark dispersoids to be TiC. This assumption was supported by the results of the XRD analysis, SAED patterns and the EDS analysis results of the bulk Nb 42 Mo 20 Ti 13 Cr 12 V 12 Ta 1 RHEA.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>(a) shows the compressive stress-strain curve for the Nb-rich HEA at room temperature, together with the fracture surface obtained from the compression test. The alloy exhibits outstanding mechanical properties, such as a yield strength of 2680 MPa, maximum strength of 3896 MPa, and fracture strain of 5.2%. The average Vickers hardness was measured to be 741 ± 5 HV. The exceptional mechanical properties of the alloy were attributed to the combined effect of the following strengthening mechanisms: solid solution strengthening, dispersion strengthening by in-situ carbides, and grain boundary strengthening.</p><p>The solid solution strengthening of the matrix phase arises due to the severe lattice distortion. This inherent property of HEAs is caused by the differences between the atomic sizes of each component of the alloy <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[41]</ref> and the interstitial strengthening effect induced by the C element. The atomic size of C is substantially smaller than that of the other alloying elements. This induces a considerable strain field, which causes the dislocation motion to be suppressed <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[42]</ref> thus enhancing the mechanical properties. The dispersion strengthening induced by the nanosized TiC molecules may be caused by the Orowan strengthening mechanism, which arises due to the presence of incoherencies between the BCC matrix and the FCC-structured TiC. The TiC dispersoids could enhance the strength of the alloy by preventing the movement of dislocations. We attribute the fine-grained structure of the alloy presented in this study to the excellent mechanical properties that arise due to hindrance of the dislocation movement. This effect is governed by the Hall-Petch relationship <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[43]</ref>. We present a comparison between the mechanical properties of our novel alloy and other BCC-based RHEAs in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>. In comparison to other BCC-based RHEAs prepared by casting methods, the strength and hardness of the Nb-rich HEA are significantly enhanced by the powder processing fabrication method.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Conclusions</head><p>In this study, we developed a novel Nb 42 Mo 20 Ti 13 Cr 12 V 12 Ta 1 RHEA with a single BCC solid solution phase. Our specimen was successfully fabricated by high-energy ball milling for 12 h, followed by SPS at 1200 °C for 5 min. By applying PM processes rather than the casting process that are usually used to fabricate BCC-based HEAs, we induced an in-situ reaction during the sintering process. This caused nano-sized TiC dispersoids to be dispersed homogeneously throughout the alloy. The Nb-rich HEA had an ultra-fine grained structure, with a grain size of 347 nm, due to the severe plastic deformation of the powders and short sintering time. Our novel alloy exhibited outstanding mechanical properties. Specifically, it had a yield strength of 2680 MPa, maximum strength of 3896 MPa, and Vickers hardness of 741 HV. We attributed these excellent mechanical properties to the extreme grain refinement and dispersion strengthening caused by the TiC that was formed in-situ, and the lattice distortion effects induced by the interstitial carbon and differences between the atomic sizes of each alloying element. The mechanical properties of the alloy fabricated by powder processes were significantly better than those of BCC-based HEAs fabricated by casting methods. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
