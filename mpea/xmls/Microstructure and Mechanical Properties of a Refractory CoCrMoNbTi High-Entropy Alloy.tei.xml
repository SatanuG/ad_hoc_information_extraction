<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In this work, a new refractory high-entropy alloy, the Co-Cr-Mo-Nb-Ti system, was proposed as a family of candidate materials for high-temperature structural applications. CoCrMoNbTi x (x values in terms of molar ratios, x = 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.5 and 1.0) alloys were prepared by vacuum arc melting. The effects of variations in the Ti content on the phase constituents, microstructure and mechanical properties of the alloys were investigated using x-ray diffractometry, scanning electron microscopy equipped with energydispersive x-ray spectroscopy and compressive testing.

The results were discussed in terms of the mixing enthalpy, atomic size difference, electronegativity difference and valance electron concentrations among the elements within alloys. The alloy hardness exhibited a slightly decreasing trend as the Ti content increased, resulting from the coarser microstructure and reduced amount of Laves phases. Augmented Ti content increased the compressive strength, but decreased the ductility.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The high-entropy alloys (HEAs), a new type of alloy system proposed originally by <ref type="bibr">Yeh et al. (Ref 1)</ref>, have attracted extensive attention in recent years. HEAs were generally composed of five or more principal elements in equal or nearequal molar ratios (Ref 2), as opposed to conventional alloy designs, which are based on one or two metals as the major components. It has been reported that HEAs predominantly consist of ideal simple solid solution phases with body-centered cubic (BCC), face-centered cubic (FCC) and/ or a mixing BCC plus FCC structures, which are often believed to result from a high mixing entropy effect (Ref 3, 4). However, other ordered solid solutions and/or intermetallic phases may also be formed in some HEAs, especially in alloys containing a large atomic size mismatch, as well as negative elemental mixing enthalpies. Meanwhile, studies have shown that in some cases, ordered solid solutions and/or intermetallic phases can act to dispersion strengthen materials (Ref 5 <ref type="bibr">-7)</ref>. Moreover, considerable studies have focused on the many unique properties of HEAs in structural materials, including high strength and hardness (Ref Since high-entropy alloys were introduced, the most commonly used elements have been transition metals, such as Cu, Al, Ni, Fe, Cr and Mn (Ref <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14)</ref>. Since 2010, in order to fully utilize the potential for high-temperature material development, intense research efforts have been dedicated to exploring novel high-entropy alloys based on refractory elements, such as Mo, W, Nb, Hf, Ti, V and Zr (Ref <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. This new alloy system, which is known as a refractory highentropy alloy, exhibits excellent elevated temperature properties.  proposed a series of refractory HEAs, NbMoTaW, NbMoTaWV and HfNbTiZrTa, all of which contain a single-phase BCC structure. NbMoTaW and NbMo-TaWV have very high yield strength up to 1058 and 1246 MPa at room temperature, respectively. Unfortunately, these two refractory alloys have rather high densities, 13.75 g/cm 3 for NbMoTaW and 12.36 g/cm 3 for NbMoTaWV, and limited ductilities of approximately 2.0 and 1.5% at room temperature, respectively. Subsequently, a HfNbTiZrTa alloy with a remarkably reduced density of q = 9.94 g/cm 3 was produced by replacing the heavier W, Mo and V with the lighter elements Hf, Zr and Ti. Moreover, the cast and hot isostatic pressed (HIP) conditions exhibited considerable strain hardening and very high ductility (e &gt; 50%) at both room and elevated temperatures. However, the alloy strength rapidly decreased below 1000 MPa at room temperature and 92 MPa at 1200 °C. Additionally, a NbCrMo 0.5 Ta 0.5 TiZr alloy in the HIP condition exhibited a high yield strength of 1595 MPa at 296 K and excellent plasticity. The alloy consisted of two disordered BCC1 and BCC2 phases and an ordered FCC (Laves C15) phase. Furthermore, Juan et al. <ref type="bibr">(Ref 23)</ref> studied the effect of Mo addition on the strength and ductility of HfMo x NbTaTiZr alloys. This alloy (x &lt; 1) is composed of a simple BCC solid solution, and the microstructures of all the studied alloys exhibit a typical dendritic structure. The yield strength increased from 1015 to 1512 MPa as the Mo concentration increased due to the solid solution strengthening effect. Very recently, a MoNbHfZrTi alloy (Ref 24) with a single BCC phase exhibited high structural stability, with a compressive yield strength of 1719 MPa at 296 K. However, several new high hardness refractory high-entropy alloys containing Ti and Al have also been reported, including Al 0.4 Hf 0.6 NbTaTiZr, NbTiVTaAl x and Al x HfNbTaTiZr (Ref 25 <ref type="bibr">-27)</ref>. These alloys exhibited promising combinations of room temperature and elevated temperature mechanical properties and oxidation resistance. Therefore, refractory high-entropy alloys provide an effective strategy for developing new high-strength alloys and may be considered a promising candidate for elevated temperature applications.</p><p>In this work, our goal was the development of a novel highstrength and low-density refractory high-entropy alloy system based on HEA design principles above. The replacement of heavier and expensive elements, such as W, V, Hf and Ta, was performed, a base composition of CoCrMoNbTi x was selected, as Nb has good ductility and fracture toughness, and Mo was added to increase the high-temperature strength. Moreover, Nb and Mo, both of which are BCC materials, formed a continuous solid solution. Thus, they may be considered as prime candidates for the new alloy system. Cr not only improves the alloy oxidation resistance but also fulfills the requirement of having the same BCC structure as Nb and Mo. In addition, Co has a better combination of wear resistance and high-temperature strength. By replacing W and Ta in the reported refractory high-entropy alloys with lighter Ti, the density and cost of the new alloy can be reduced. Therefore, a novel series of CoCrMoNbTi x (x values in molar ratio, x = 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.5 and 1.0) alloys were synthesized via an arc melting process in this paper. Here, the phase constituents, microstructures, microhardnesses and mechanical properties of the alloys were systematically investigated. The effect of Ti on the phases and microstructures in Co-Cr-Mo-Nb-Ti alloys were studied in detail. Furthermore, the work here is expected to provide a reference for the further study and application of these alloys.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Experimental Procedures</head><p>Refractory high-entropy alloy ingots with a nominal composition of CoCrMoNbTi x (x values in terms of the molar ratio, x = 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.5 and 1.0-the alloys were denoted as Ti0, Ti0.2, Ti0.4, Ti0.5 and Ti1.0, respectively) were prepared by vacuum arc melting in a high-purity argon atmosphere to prevent oxidation. The starting materials were powdered with a purity in excess of 99.9 wt.% each. The nominal chemical compositions of all the alloys are listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. After the vacuum pressure reached 4 9 10 3 Pa, melting and casting was performed at a pressure of 0.01 atm via Ar backfill. Each specimen was repeatedly melted at least five (5) times to ensure the chemical homogeneity. Arc melting of the alloys was conducted in a water-cooled copper hearth. The diameter and length of the button ingots were 30 and 15 mm, respectively.</p><p>A piece from the interior of each ingot sample was sectioned to obtain material for testing and analysis. X-ray diffraction (XRD, Bruker AXS, Germany) was used to detect the constituent phases and crystal structure using monochromatic Cu-Ka radiation at 40 kV. The diffraction data were collected over a 2h range from 20°to 100°with a step size of 0.01°and 10 s dwell time per step. The microstructure was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, ZEISS SUPRA 55), and the chemical compositions were analyzed using SEM energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDX). The density of the specimens was measured using the ArchimedesÕ method with water as the immersion medium. An analytical digital balance with an accuracy of 0.1 mg was used to measure the weight and volume of the samples. The hardnesses of the samples were measured on polished surfaces using a Vickers microhardness tester (Wolpert Wilson Instruments 401MVD) with a 500 g load and a dwell time of 15 s. Hardness measurements were performed on at least seven points with a pitch of 0.5 mm to determine an average for each sample. The room temperature compressive properties were evaluated using a CMT4105 testing machine in air. The test specimens used were in the shape of a cylinder (U3 mm 9 6 mm) and tested at a strain rate of 1 9 10 À3 s À1 . Each specimen was tested three  (3) times under identical testing conditions, and the fracture surface was analyzed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Results and Discussion</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Crystal Structure</head><p>From representative x-ray diffraction patterns of the as-cast CoCrMoNbTi x (x = 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.5 and 1.0) as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>, it can be seen that all the alloys were composed of a major disordered BCC solid solution phase. A tiny BCC peak was observed at approximately 31°in the XRD patterns for the Ti0, Ti0.5, Ti1.0 and some Ti0.2 and Ti0.4 alloys, suggesting that an ordered BCC phase exists in the alloys. The Ti0 and Ti0.2 alloys display a predominant BCC phase accompanied by the Laves phase, which was identified as a Cr 2 Nb type with a hexagonal close-packed (HCP) lattice structure in accordance with the Powder Diffraction File edited by International Center for Diffraction Data (Ref 28). It was clear that the Ti0.4 alloy was only composed of a single BCC crystal structure. Moreover, as the molar ratio of the Ti was increased to 0.5 and 1.0, in addition to strong BCC solid solution diffraction peaks and the Cr 2 Nb Laves phases, there were reflections from another Laves phase with lattice parameters of a = 0.473 nm and c = 1.541 nm. This was subsequently identified as a hexagonal close-packed Co 2 Ti phase. One conclusion can be drawn that Ti addition of at least 11.1 at.% promotes the formation of Co 2 Ti-type intermetallic phases. From the x-ray diffraction analysis, the primary phases of all alloys are still BCC solid solution phases, although an extra minor phase precipitated. The lattice constants for the solid solution were estimated from the strongest (100) BCC peak via BraggÕs law (Ref 29) and calculated from the XRD data with the results listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>. The lattice parameters for the BCC phases gradually increased from 3.1471 to 3.1532 A ˚This phenomenon was expected, as the atomic radius of Ti is much larger than the other constituent elements (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>). The addition of Ti not only introduced lattice strains but also affected the microstructure of the alloys.</p><p>According to the Gibbs phase rule, F = C À P + 1 (where F is a degree of freedom, C is the number of components and P is the number of phases), the maximum number of equilibrium phases in a C component system at constant pressure is P = C + 1. When an alloy solidifies under non-equilibrium condition, the expression P &gt; C + 1 holds true. However, in this research, a simple BCC solid solution is the main phase prior to the formation of intermetallic phases in the CoCr-MoNbTi x alloys, and the total number of phases was significantly less than the maximum equilibrium number allowed by the Gibbs phase rule.</p><p>Compared with the traditional alloy containing many elements, the prior formation of the BCC solid solution before the intermetallic compounds in this alloy system was attributed to the high mixing entropy effect. Recently, several studies have been carried out to determine the criteria for phase formation in HEAs. From the available data, two key parameters are proposed by Zhang and Yang (Ref 30), including X and d, which are defined as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">X ¼ T m DS mix DH mix ; ðEq 1Þ d ¼ ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi ffi X n i¼1 C i 1 À r i = r ð Þ 2 s ; ðEq<label>2Þ</label></formula><p>where c i is the atomic percentage of the ith component, r i is the atomic radius of the ith component and r is the average atomic radius. The variable</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">T m ¼ P n i¼1 C i T m ð Þ i is the melting point of the alloy ( T m</formula><p>ð Þ i is the melting point of the ith component), DS mix is the mixing entropy and DH mix is the mixing enthalpy of the alloys, which are calculated from</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">DH mix ¼ 4 X n i¼0 DH mix ij c i c j ; ðEq<label>3Þ</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_3">DS mix ¼ ÀR X n i¼1 c i ln c i ð Þ; ; ðEq<label>4Þ</label></formula><p>where DH mix ij is the mixing enthalpy for a binary liquid alloy and R (=8.314 J K À1 mol À1 ) is the universal gas constant. From the available data, values of X &gt; 1.1 and d &lt; 6.6% favor the formation of a single solid solution phase, respectively. The values for DH mix ij for the CoCrMoNbTi x HEAs are obtained from Ref 31 and listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>.</p><p>More recently, in addition to these parameters, Guo et al. (Ref 32) defined another parameter, known as VEC, which describes the valence electron concentration of a multicomponent alloy system:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">VEC ¼ X n i¼1 c i VEC ð Þ i ; ðEq<label>5Þ</label></formula><p>where VEC ð Þ i is the VEC for an individual element and may be obtained from Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>  the HEA structure type was effectively predicted from the VEC criterion. The authors also point out that the BCC phase is more stable, having a VEC value less than 6.87, whereas the FCC phase has a value greater than 8.0. For the refractory CoCrMoNbTi x HEA systems in this work, the values for X, d and VEC were calculated and listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">5</ref>. The Ti0 and Ti1.0 alloys had a relatively large X and a small d, fulfilling the criteria for solid solution phase formation (which are X &gt; 1.1 and d &lt; 6.6%). However, the Cr 2 Nb and Co 2 Ti phases formed in these two alloys. Furthermore, for the Ti0.4 alloy, the value of X was calculated to be 0.3, which did not fulfill the criteria, despite the Ti0.4 alloy only consisting of a single BCC solid solution. Therefore, the criterion specified for HEAs presented here appears insufficient for predicting solid solution formation in multicomponent HEAs. The reason for the formation of the Laves Cr 2 Nb and Co 2 Ti phases should be related to the difference in both the atomic ratio and mixing enthalpy of the constituent elements. The formation of solid solutions and compounds may be effected by many factors, such as differences in electronegativity, atomic size, electron concentration, chemical bonds, etc. Among these, atomic size plays an important role. Greater differences in the atomic radius result in larger interstices for atoms to diffuse into, resulting in the easier formation of different compounds. The atomic radii of the constituent elements used in this work are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>. From Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>, we see that the difference in the atomic radii of the Cr-Nb and Co-Ti systems is larger. The atomic radius of Nb (1.429 A ˚) is greater than that of Cr (1.249 A ˚), and the atomic radius of Ti (1.462 A ˚) is greater than that of Cr (1.251 A ˚). Elemental substitution with large radii differences of atoms induced lattice distortion. It is also noted that the lattice parameter difference was large, as shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>, which caused an obvious lattice straining effect. In other words, large lattice distortion energies would destabilize the BCC solid solution matrix and promote the formation of the Cr 2 Nb-and Co 2 Ti-type Laves phases.</p><p>Furthermore, Co and Nb have large negative enthalpies of mixing compared to the other alloying elements. As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>, the mixing enthalpies DH mix ij for Co with any of the other elements (Ti, Nb, Mo and Cr) are significantly less than zero. Mixing enthalpy reflects the tendency to form stable intermetallic compounds. Consequently, the Co 2 Ti phase formation should be related to the most mixing enthalpy between Co and Ti, which is À28 kJ/mol. Meanwhile, the more negative mixing enthalpy value corresponding to the Nb-Cr pairs is also observed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>. It is concluded that the Cr 2 Nb Laves intermetallic phases form due to the negative mixing enthalpy of Nb and Cr.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Microstructure</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> shows SEM backscattering electron images of the as-cast refractory CoCrMoNbTi x alloys. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>(a), (b), (c), (d), (e) and (f) corresponds to the Ti0, Ti0.2, Ti0.4, Ti0.5 and Ti1.0 alloys, respectively. Cast dendritic and interdendritic structures are observed in all alloys, which are typical of many HEAs (Ref 33). Furthermore, with the exception of the Ti0.4 alloy, all the alloys exhibited three distinct regions with different colors-bright, gray and dark. To facilitate further discussions, the microstructures were mainly distinguished as dendrite, interdendrite and secondary-phase regions, respectively. The average chemical compositions of the different regions of the HEAs were measured by EDS, with the results given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">6</ref>. For all the alloys, the Mo segregated preferentially to the dendritic regions, whereas the Co elements preferred to the interdendritic regions. The distribution of Nb was relatively homogeneous.</p><p>The microstructures of the base alloy CoCrMoNb or the Ti0 exhibited an obviously coarse dendritic microstructure, with an average primary arm width of approximately 5.5 lm, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2(a)</ref>. There are obvious dark secondary-phase regions that precipitated in the interdendritic regions and exhibited irregular shapes. According to EDS results shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">6</ref>, the dendrite region is rich in Mo that has the highest melting point. In contrast, the interdendritic region is rich in Co with the lowest melting point. There is more Nb and Cr segregated in the irregular dark regions. Combining the EDS results with the corresponding XRD patterns (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>), both the dendritic and interdendritic regions are determined to be a BCC solid solution phase. A Laves Cr 2 Nb phase precipitated from the BCC phase. After the addition of Ti to the base alloy, there are no The superscript ''*'' denotes the empirical criterion for the forming of the solid solution phase remarkable differences in the white dendritic microstructure of the Ti0.2 alloy in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>(b), except for slight changes in the grain size and proportions of the interdendritic microstructure. The average dendrite arm width was approximately 7 lm. The interdendritic microstructure increased, whereas the dark Laves Cr 2 Nb phases substantially decreased, preferring to form in the interdendritic regions. For the Ti0.4 alloy, a strong contrast corresponding to the white dendritic and gray interdendritic regions is observed, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2(c</ref>). The primary dendrites had a larger arm width of approximately 12 lm and only consisted of the BCC solid solution phase. Combining the EDS results with the corresponding XRD patterns (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>),  we see that the Ti0.4 alloy possesses only one BCC structure.</p><p>From the EDS mapping analysis of every element in the Ti0.4 alloy, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>, the qualitative segregation characteristics can be visualized. Note that Mo and, to some extent, Nb (which have higher melting points) preferentially segregated to the dendritic arms (white regions), as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3(d</ref>) and (e), whereas the Cr and Co, which have lower melting points, are clearly observed enriching the interdendritic regions (gray regions), as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3(b)</ref> and<ref type="figure">(c</ref>). In addition, it is noticed that the distribution of Ti was uniform throughout the dendritic and interdendritic structures shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>(f), which is also a consequence of maintaining a lower system free energy. Elemental segregation is generally associated with differences in the melting temperatures of the constituent elements (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>). As the amount of Ti added increases, dark Laves phase precipitates from the interdendritic regions. Analyzing Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2(d</ref>) and (e), we see that the dendrite size is approximately 8 lm for the Ti0.5 alloy, whereas the Ti1.0 alloy had a coarser grain size, on the order of 9.8 lm. We determine from the XRD and EDS results that both the dendritic and interdendritic regions have a BCC solid solution structure, whereas the Laves phase must be a Co 2 Ti-and Cr 2 Nb-type intermetallic compound. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2(d)</ref>, (e) and (f), the microstructure of the Ti0.5 alloy is similar to that of the Ti1.0 alloys. For the Ti0.5 and Ti1.0 alloys, the BCC solid solution forms as the matrix, whereas the Laves phases distributed discontinuously with irregular shapes. The difference lies in the Laves phase only existing around the interdendritic boundaries for the Ti0.5 alloy, whereas for the Ti1.0 alloy, the Laves phases precipitate from the dendritic branch structure, resulting in the generation of individual islands in the dendritic regions. In particular, it should be noted that there is eutectic lamellar microstructure observed in the interdendritic regions of the Ti1.0 alloy, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>(f), and in detail in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2(e</ref>). The eutectic structure consists of a mixture of BCC and Laves phases, which constitute a continuous network. Meanwhile, as the Ti content increases, the volume fraction of the Laves phase increases accordingly.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Density</head><p>The measured density of the CoCrMoNbTi 0.4 alloy is 8.366 g/cm 3 , which is much lower than for the other HEAs containing heavier refractory elements <ref type="bibr">(Ref 19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21)</ref>. This may be compared to the theoretical density for a disordered BCC solid solution in a CoCrMoNbTi 0.4 alloy, which may be estimated using the rule of mixtures: </p><formula xml:id="formula_5">q theor ¼ P c i A i P c i A i q i i; ðEq<label>6Þ</label></formula><p>where c i is the molar composition of an element, A i is the atomic weight and q i is the density of the pure element i.</p><p>The calculated density for the CoCrMoNbTi 0.4 alloy in this study is 8.306% g/cm 3 , which is approximately 0.7% higher than theoretically expected for a disordered solid solution, and agrees with the earlier x-ray analysis. The small difference between the measured and theoretical densities may be caused by the compositional non-uniformity in the arc-melted sample and measurement uncertainty.</p></div>

The tested alloys had a relatively high hardness, which is explained by the presence of a large amount of BCC phases. The differences among the atomic radii of the different elements caused the lattice distortions to become more severe, enhancing the solid solution strengthening effect and the high hardness.</p><p>As more Ti is added, the hardness values of the HEAs decrease markedly. The hardness of the Ti0.4 alloys is approximately 830 HV 0.5 , which is lower than the Ti0 and Ti0.2 alloys. The higher hardnesses of the Ti0 and Ti0.2 alloys are attributed to the precipitation strengthening effect from the formation of the Laves phases compared to the Ti0.4 alloy. According to the XRD results and the SEM analysis, the proportion of the Cr 2 Nb-type Laves phases decreased over the x range from 0 £ x £ 0.4. The slightly higher hardness for the Ti0 alloy was due to the amount of Laves phase that formed in the interdendritic regions of the Ti0 alloy, which were more than for the Ti0.2 alloy. Subsequently, the hardness for the Ti0.4 alloy decreased slightly. This is because the Ti0.4 alloy is composed only of a BCC solid solution phase and coarser microstructures with grains of 12 lm, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2(c</ref>). As the Ti content increased further, the effect on the hardness was minimal. Slightly higher hardnesses of 844.44 HV 0.5 and 848.62 HV 0.5 were obtained for the Ti0.5 and Ti1.0 alloys, respectively. The increase in hardness is explained by the large amount of BCC and Cr 2 Nb and Co 2 Ti Laves phase that precipitated, as confirmed in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>. Additionally, the decrease in grain sizes to widths of approximately 8.5 and 9.84 lm, respectively, likely contributed to the higher hardness by reducing the mean free path length for dislocation motion. Therefore, we believe that the alloy strengthening is attributed to both solid solution strengthening from the BCC matrix and precipitation hardening from the formation of hard secondary phases (Laves phases).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5">Compression Testing</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref> shows the room temperature compressive engineering stress-strain curves for the CoCrMoNbTi x alloys with different Ti contents. The fracture strength and strain results for the NbMoCrCoTi x alloys are listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">7</ref>. The results show that highest fracture strength for the Ti0.2 alloy was 1906 MPa, and the largest fracture strain was for the Ti0 alloy at 5.77%. The Ti1.0 alloy exhibited the lowest compressive strength and fracture strain, 1097 MPa and 3.88%, respectively. The Ti content had a very pronounced effect on the compressive behavior of the alloys. When the Ti content is less than 0.2, alloy fracture strength increases with the Ti content. However, when the Ti content is greater than 0.2, the opposite occurs and the strain changes slightly more than the fracture strength. As the Ti content increases to x = 0.2, the maximum compressive strength exhibits a slight increase to 1906 MPa, but the deformation sharply decreases to 5.1%. For the Ti1.0 alloy, the results were an elastic strain of only 3.9% and a fracture strength of 1097 MPa. It is worth noting that, comparatively, the compressive strength of the studied alloy was better than for earlier reported developmental refractory high-entropy alloys, as shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">7</ref>. The improved alloy strength may be attributed to the formation of the BCC solid solution phase with strong bonding inherited from the refractory elements and high degrees of solid solution strengthening. Moreover, the solution strengthening in the BCC matrix is enhanced by the increased lattice distortion caused by the atomic size difference, as shown in Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>. However, the alloy is more brittle than other reference refractory high-entropy alloys (Ref 33, 34), despite exhibiting a higher compression strength. The relatively large volume fraction of strong-but-brittle Laves phases in the alloys resulted in considerable decreases in the ductility. Additionally, the ductility further decreased with increasing Laves phase volume fraction, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>. Thus, the alloy compressive strength improved by sacrificing ductility, which is attributed to the solid solution strengthening of the BCC structure and the formation of the Laves phases. It is expected that the alloy compressive strength will be a strong function of microstructural parameters, such as the phase composition and grain size. As reported that both the compressive strength and plasticity of the Mo 0.5 NbHf 0.5 ZrTi HEA had been improved by the addition of Si or C, due to the precipitation of particulatereinforced M 5 Si 3 or MC phases <ref type="bibr">(Ref 17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33)</ref>. Meanwhile, it was determined that annealing may improve the ductility of as-cast HEAs. <ref type="bibr">Senkov et al. (Ref 20)</ref> also reported that the refractory alloy, TaNbHfZrTi, produced by vacuum arc melting and followed by HIP had predominantly high compression yield strength (d 0.2 = 929 MPa) and ductility (e &gt; 50%). The alloy showed considerable strain hardening and homogeneous deformation. The good ductility of the HIP alloy was probably due to simultaneous dislocation and twinning activity, which effectively reduces stress localization along grain boundaries. Hence, further studies on improving the compressive ductility at higher strengths are necessary and will be conducted. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Conclusions</head><p>In this study, by applying the strategy of equiatomic ratios and high entropies of mixing, Ti content additions into the Co-Cr-Mo-Nb-Ti are proposed as a family of candidate materials for high-temperature structural applications. The CoCrMoNb-Ti x alloy series (x values in terms of the molar ratio, x = 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.5 and 1.0) exhibited a relatively simple microstructure and promising properties.   </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>8), good wear resistance (Ref 9), outstanding structural stability (Ref 10), excellent corrosion resistance (Ref 11) and exceptional elevated temperature properties (Ref 12).

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_5"><head>( 1 )</head><label>1</label><figDesc>The microstructures of all studied alloys, with the exception of the CoCrMoNbTi 0.4 alloy, exhibited a typical dendritic structure, corresponding to the majority BCC solid solution and other Laves phases (Cr 2 Nb and/ or Co 2 Ti). The Ti0.4 alloy is composed of only a single BCC phase. (2) Mo and Nb were enriched in the coarse dendritic regions, whereas Co and Cr were distributed in the interdendritic regions and Ti was uniformly distributed throughout both regions. (3) The hardnesses of the alloys decreased slightly as the Ti content increased. The Ti0 alloys exhibited the highest hardnesses up to 959.62 HV 0.5 . This feature is ascribed to the coarser microstructure and reduced amount of Laves phase. 4) Augmented Ti content increased the compressive strength but decreased the ductility. The Ti0.2 alloy exhibited a compressive strength of 1906 MPa and a fracture strain of 5.07%. The solid solution strengthening of the BCC matrix and the formation of hard Laves phases are the two main factors contributing to alloy strengthening. (5) This work provides some guidance for the further development of current ideas to obtain refractory high-temperature structural materials. Further studies are being carried out to investigate the phase stability and hightemperature mechanical properties of the alloy.</figDesc></figure>
