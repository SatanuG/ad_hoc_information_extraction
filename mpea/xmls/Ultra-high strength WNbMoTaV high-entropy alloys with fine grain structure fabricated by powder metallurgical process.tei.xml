<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The design of traditional alloys is based on alloying one or two principal elements, e.g., Fe, Ti, Al or W, with a small amount of other elements added to improve properties by controlling the microstructures. However, developing novel alloys using this conventional concept is restricted by the inherent limitation of the number of alloy systems. In the mid-1990s, Yeh et al. presented a new multi-principal element alloying design concept <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Alloys designed by this novel method were named "high-entropy alloys" (HEAs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. An HEA is defined as an alloy system consisting of at least five principal elements in an equiatomic or near-equiatomic ratio (5-35 at.%). It was expected that this alloying approach would induce the formation of intermetallic or complex phases and lead to poor mechanical properties <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</p><p>However, because of the high mixing entropy effect among the different constituents of the HEAs, the microstructure is stabilized by simple solid solution phases with face-centeredcubic (FCC) or body-centered-cubic (BCC) structures without forming intermetallic compounds <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Moreover, multi-principal element alloying with high mixing entropy induces a lattice distortion effect that provides strong solid solution strengthening. HEAs typically have excellent mechanical properties <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref>, resistance to wear, oxidation and corrosion <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, and good thermal stability <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>; therefore they have great potential in a variety of structural and functional applications.</p><p>The numerous reported methods for fabricating HEAs include vacuum arc-melting and casting <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, sputtering <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, laser cladding <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref> and mechanical alloying (MA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>. Among these approaches, most HEAs have been made by vacuum arc-melting and casting. However, this route is suitable only at the lab-scale because of the very high melting temperatures of the constituents. Additionally, further heat treatment is necessary to homogenize the microstructure because of the formation of an inhomogeneous dendritic microstructure during the casting. A few HEA systems manufactured by the MA process have recently been reported <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. This process can readily fabricate HEA powders having homogeneous morphologies using simple and precise composition control. A subsequent consolidation process using spark plasma sintering (SPS) is typically used to make bulk highdensity HEAs. The MA and SPS processes provide ultrafine grains with excellent microstructural homogeneity and improved strength and hardness compared with those of HEAs fabricated by the arc-melting and casting process, as summarized in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>.</p><p>Since the concept of HEAs was first proposed in 2004, the scope of alloy systems forming stable HEAs has been gradually expanding. Little research on refractory HEAs containing high-melting elements, such as W, Ta and Mo, has been reported since Senkov et al. first synthesized and evaluated the mechanical properties of the WNbMoTaV and WNbMoTa HEAs <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>. To date, all of the reported refractory HEAs have been fabricated by the arcmelting and casting process. We are not aware of any publications concerning the fabrication of refractory HEAs using the MA and SPS powder metallurgical processes. Given the high melting temperatures of refractory elements, the preparation of bulk samples of refractory HEAs using these powder metallurgical processes is simpler than the arc-melting and casting process. Additionally, the powder metallurgical process is more appropriate for the fabrication of small and precise HEA components that are exposed to extremely high temperatures. It is thus important to study the powder metallurgical process as a facile route to refractory HEAs to broaden their applications.</p><p>In this research, a BCC-based HEA composed of refractory alloying elements was fabricated by a powder metallurgical process and thoroughly characterized. We focused on the HEA system of WNbMoTaV, which exhibited the best high-temperature strength among the reported HEA systems fabricated by the conventional arc-melting and casting method <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>. The objective of the current study was to establish a powder metallurgical process for synthesizing the WNbMoTaV HEA and to characterize its phases, microstructure and roomtemperature mechanical properties. The MA behavior was extensively studied. Additionally, quantitative approaches were used to identify possible mechanisms to explain the high yield strength.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Methods</head><p>The WNbMoTaV HEA powder was fabricated by high-energy ball milling of elemental W, Nb, Ta, V and Mo powders. All of the elemental powders had purities exceeding 99% and particle sizes smaller than 75 μm. The raw powders at equiatomic ratio were placed in an SKD11-steel bowl filled with tungsten carbide balls (7 mm in diameter). The MA process was conducted without a process control agent (PCA) in a high-energy planetary ball mill (Pulverisette 5) at 300 rpm, with a ball-to-powder ratio of 10:1, and in a high-purity argon gas atmosphere to prevent oxidation. Before the effective milling, 2 h of pre-milling was carried out with a few grams of elemental powder to coat the grinding bowl and balls. To analyze the MA behavior of the HEA powders, powder samples (ca. 1 g) were sampled after 0, 2, 4 and 6 h of milling. All of these procedures were carried out inside a glove box (model J-924A; JISICO, Korea) to prevent oxidation of the HEA powders. The powders ball milled for 6 h were sintered by SPS (model SPS-515S; Fuji Electronic Industrial, Japan) at a pressure of 50 MPa under vacuum (&lt; 10 Pa). The sintering temperatures for the SPS process were 1,500, 1,600 and 1,700°C. The powders were heated to 600°C within 1 min, and from 600°C to the desired sintering temperature at a heating rate of 100°C min -1 , followed by 5 min of holding time at the sintering temperature. The temperature of the specimen during SPS was measured using an infrared pyrometer.</p><p>The crystal structure of the alloyed powders and sintered bulk specimens were analyzed by an X-ray diffraction (XRD) (model D/MAX-2500; Rigaku) using Cu Kα radiation. The microstructure of the WNbMoTaV HEA was observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (model S-4800; Hitachi, Japan) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS).</p><p>Metallographic specimens were prepared by grinding, polishing and chemical etching in an aqueous solution composed of 5 wt% KOH and 5 wt% K 3 FeCN 6 . The grain size of the matrix, volume fraction and average radius of oxide inclusions were quantitatively examined by using image analysis software (ImagePartner; Saramsoft Co. Ltd., Korea). The density of the WNbMoTaV HEA was determined using Archimedes' method with distilled water.</p><p>Microhardness measurements were taken using a Vickers hardness tester (model HM-124; Akashi, Japan) under a load of 9.8 N with a loading time of 10 s; the average of 10 measurements is reported. Compressive stress-strain testing was conducted at room temperature using a universal testing machine (model 4402; Instron) with cylindrical specimens (3 mm diameter × 4.5 mm long) at an engineering strain rate of 0.001 s -1 . The representative data for each condition were obtained by averaging three values of the test results.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Phases and microstructural analysis of the WNbMoTaV HEA powders during MA</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows the XRD patterns of the WNbMoTaV HEA powders for different milling times. Before the MA process, the blended powders exhibited diffraction patterns for all of the pure alloying elements. The patterns prior the milling were showing that the peak intensities of V were relatively lower than those of the other elements due to the least atomic weight, because the peak intensities of each element are affected by the atomic number of the constituents <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. The intensity of the diffraction peaks declined dramatically after 2 h of milling, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1(a)</ref>. Peak broadening occurred at longer milling times because of crystal size refinement, higher lattice strain and reduced crystallinity <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref>. The crystallite size and lattice strain of the WNbMoTaV HEA powders were calculated according to the Williamson-Hall method after excluding instrumental broadening <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. After 6 h of milling, nanocrystalline HEA powders were obtained with a crystallite size of 66.1 nm and a lattice strain of 0.96%. As shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>(b), the shift in peak locations to lower Bragg's angle with increasing milling time (up to 6 h) was consistent with an increasing lattice parameter.</p><p>The two-theta values of (110) plane were measured at 40.166° (2 h), 40.027° (4 h) and 39.992° (6 h), respectively. This was attributed to the incorporation of elements having larger atomic size (Nb: 3.30 Å, Ta: 3.31 Å), than the others (W: 3.16 Å, Mo: 3.15 Å, V: 3.03 Å) during the MA process. The lattice parameter of the WNbMoTaV HEA powder determined from the XRD pattern after 6 h of milling was 3.186 Å. At 6 h of MA, the peaks of the principal elements had disappeared to leave three intense peaks located between those of pure W and Ta; these corresponded to a body-centered cubic (BCC) structure (PDF card no. 65-9439 for NbV).  detected. The Nb and Ta peaks had nearly the same locations, and it was difficult to confirm complete dissolution of Nb after 4 h of milling. As the milling time increased to 6 h, however, the residual peaks of Ta/Nb completely disappeared, indicating complete dissolution of these elements into the BCC solid solution. In fact, the alloying sequence of the constituents is related to the melting point of the component elements <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>; an element with a lower melting point has a higher intrinsic diffusion coefficient in the solid state <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. Generally, a component with a higher melting point would possess stronger atomic bonding, leading to a lower diffusion coefficient. When the alloy components have similar melting points, such as Mo and Nb, the alloying rate is proportional to the brittleness of the pure elements <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>.</p><p>Therefore, the predicted alloying sequence is V  Mo  Nb  Ta  W, which is consistent with the XRD analyses (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> shows SEM images of the microstructure of the WNbMoTaV HEA powders after different milling times. In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>(a), the initially blended HEA powders had a broad particle size distribution and an average particle size of less than 75 μm. The subsequent MA process caused repeated flattening, cold welding, fracturing and re-welding of the powders. The impact of the balls during the milling process deformed the powders, which led to workhardening of the powders. Since the powders were softer and less deformed in the early stages of milling, their tendency to weld together and agglomerate was strong. As the milling time increased, the powders became work hardened and embrittled, which increased the tendency to fracture <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. These phenomena are evident in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2(b)</ref> and<ref type="figure">(c</ref>). In the early MA stage of 2 h of milling (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2(b)</ref>), the HEA powders cold welded together and tended to have increased average size compared with that before MA. After the initial strong cold welding of the particles, fracture dominated, the average particle size decreased and the size distribution narrowed (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2(c)</ref>). After 6 h of MA, the average particle size of the WNbMoTaV HEA had reduced to 1.83 μm. Semi-quantitative EDS analysis of the 6 h-milled HEA powders (squared area in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>(c) and Table <ref type="table">2</ref>) revealed that the composition of each element had reached almost the same level of 20 at.%, which confirmed that chemical homogeneity had been achieved. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2(d)-(f</ref>) displays cross-sectional SEM images of the 2, 4 and 6 h-milled powders. During the MA, the powders were repeatedly flattened and cold welded, which resulted in the lamellar structure observed in cross-sectional images <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. At the early stage of 2 h of milling, the powders were relatively coarse, and there was wide interlayer spacing (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2(d)</ref>). As the milling time increased, the powders became finer and the inter-lamellar spacing decreased (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2(e)</ref>). Finally, the inter-lamellar spacing became so small that the layered structure was no longer apparent in the SEM images after 6 h of the MA process (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>(f)). Three experimental results were used to establish the optimal MA time for subsequent consolidation: (1) a single BCC crystal structure, (2) no changes to the lamellar structure, and</p><p>(3) chemical homogeneity of the compositions. As noted above, after 6 h of milling, there were no XRD peaks except those of a single BCC structure. This meant that the alloying of each constituent was complete at 6 h of MA. Additionally, the disappearance of the interlamellar layer meant that the saturation and refinement of the particle size would be sufficient to achieve a high relative density of the bulk specimen in the subsequent sintering process.</p><p>Furthermore, the EDS results of the powders after 6 h of milling indicated a homogeneous atomic ratio of the constituents. Therefore, at least 6 h of milling time is necessary to obtain homogeneous and fine WNbMoTaV HEA powders. Contamination during MA commonly occurs by wear of the milling medium and from the milling atmosphere <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36]</ref>. To mitigate these issues, we limited milling of the WNbMoTaV HEA powders to 6 h.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Phase and microstructural analysis of the bulk WNbMoTaV HEA</head><p>The XRD patterns of the spark plasma sintered (SPSed) bulk specimens, at different temperatures in the range of 1,500-1,700°C, are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref>  extensive research has been conducted to identify parameters that can predict the stability of those phases <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>. Thermodynamic parameters such as the enthalpy of mixing (∆𝐻 𝑚𝑖𝑥 ), entropy of mixing (∆𝑆 𝑚𝑖𝑥 ) and the atomic size difference parameter (δ) are closely related to the formation of stable solid solution phases. Notably, King et al. advanced a two-parameter model to predict the formation and stability of single-phase HEAs using Miedema's model as a basis <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>. The model correctly predicted the stability of a single phase in 177 of 185 reported HEA systems. The thermodynamic parameter (Φ), which is the ratio of the Gibbs free energy of a completely disordered solid solution to that of the most possible intermetallic, is defined as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Φ = ∆𝐺 𝑠𝑠 -|∆𝐺 𝑚𝑎𝑥 |<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where ∆𝐺 𝑠𝑠 is the change in Gibbs free energy for the formation of a fully disordered solid solution from a mixture of its individual elements, and ∆𝐺 𝑚𝑎𝑥 is the lowest or highest possible Gibbs free energy change that is obtainable from the formation of binary systems from the alloy elements <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>. When Φ ≥ 1, the formation of a disordered solid solution becomes stable at the melting temperature of the system. The atomic size difference, which was first proposed by Yang et al., is defined as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">δ = √∑ 𝑐 𝑖 𝑛 𝑖=1</formula><p>(1 -</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">𝑟 𝑖 𝑟̅ ) 2<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where 𝑐 𝑖 is the atomic percentage of the 𝑖 𝑡ℎ element, 𝑟̅ is the average atomic radius and 𝑟 𝑖 is the atomic radius of the 𝑖 𝑡ℎ element <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. Single-phase HEAs are predicted when Φ ≥ 1 and δ &lt; 6.6 are satisfied simultaneously <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>. Furthermore, the crystal structure of the solid solution phase can be predicted by the valence electron concentration (𝑉𝐸𝐶) of the HEA system <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>. The 𝑉𝐸𝐶 of a multi-component HEA is calculated as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">𝑉𝐸𝐶 = ∑ (𝑉𝐸𝐶) 𝑖 𝑐 𝑖 𝑛 𝑖=1<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where (𝑉𝐸𝐶) 𝑖 is the 𝑉𝐸𝐶 of the 𝑖 𝑡ℎ element. Guo et al. found that an FCC structure forms when 𝑉𝐸𝐶 ≥ 8.0, both FCC and BCC phases construct stable solid solutions when 6.87 ≤ 𝑉𝐸𝐶 &lt; 8.0, and a sole BCC solid solution phase is stable when 𝑉𝐸𝐶 &lt; 6.87 <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>. In the case of the WNbMoTaV HEA, the calculated values of Φ and δ are 1.7 and 3.28, respectively. It is evident that the WNbMoTaV HEA satisfies the criteria for the formation of a single solid solution. Additionally, the 𝑉𝐸𝐶 value of the WNbMoTaV HEA is 5.4.</p><p>Therefore, the WNbMoTaV HEA is predicted to exhibit a disordered BCC solid solution phase, which is in good agreement with the XRD results discussed above.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">3</ref>). The EDS analysis results indicate that the distribution of the constituents was more homogeneous in the matrix than in the inclusions. The latter were enriched in Ta and V compared with the other alloy components and had a much higher oxygen content than the matrix. In addition, an inhomogeneous dendritic microstructure with a grain size of ca. 80 μm <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. However, by applying the MA and SPS powder metallurgical processes, a more homogeneous microstructure with finer grain size was achieved. Moreover, the relative density of the WNbMoTaV HEA bulk specimens, calculated with respect to the theoretical density, exceeded 99.5%. Thus, our powder metallurgical route enabled the fabrication of WNbMoTaV HEA with a homogeneous microstructure and high relative density. the area marked as a rectangular.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Mechanical properties of the WNbMoTaV HEA</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">5</ref> shows the engineering compressive stress-strain curve of the SPSed bulk specimen of WNbMoTaV HEA at room temperature. The bulk specimen sintered at 1,500°C displayed an outstanding compressive yield strength of 2,612 MPa and a plastic strain of 8.8%. The yield strength of the WNbMoTaV HEA studied in this work was significantly enhanced over that of arc-melted and cast WNbMoTaV HEA, which has a yield strength of 1,246 MPa and an 80 μm grain size <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. The ultra-high mechanical properties of this alloy are attributed to the following effects: solid solution strengthening arising from a severe lattice distortion, which is an inherent characteristic of HEAs <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>, solid solution strengthening by interstitial elements such as C and O <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>, grain boundary strengthening governed by the Hall-Petch relationship <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39]</ref> and Orowan strengthening by oxide inclusions <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>. Because each mechanism operates independently, the yield strength is a combination of the four mechanisms and can be expressed as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">𝜎 𝑦 = 𝜎 0 + 𝜎 𝑠𝑠 + 𝜎 𝑜𝑟 + 𝜎 𝑖𝑠𝑠 + 𝜎 𝑔𝑏 (<label>4</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_5">)</formula><p>where 𝜎 0 is the intrinsic strength related to the lattice frictional strength of the WNbMoTaV HEA and 𝜎 𝑠𝑠 , 𝜎 𝑜𝑟 , 𝜎 𝑖𝑠𝑠 and 𝜎 𝑔𝑏 are the strengthening contributions of the solid solution,</p><p>Orowan, interstitial solid solution and grain boundary, respectively. These strengthening contributions are discussed in detail below.</p><p>Concerning strengthening by precipitates, there are two mechanisms: (1) a dislocation shearing mechanism that acts between the matrix and coherent particles whose radii are smaller than a critical value, and (2) the Orowan strengthening mechanism, which applies to coherent particles whose radii are greater than the critical value or to incoherent particles <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>.</p><p>The oxide inclusions in the WNbMoTaV HEA microstructure had a hexagonal structure, which is incoherent with the BCC matrix. Thus, the Orowan strengthening mechanism is more appropriate to describe precipitate strengthening of the studied bulk specimen. The contribution of Orowan strengthening (𝜎 𝑜𝑟 ) is described by the following equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">𝜎 𝑜𝑟 = 𝑀 0.4𝐺𝑏 𝜋𝜆 ln (2𝑟̅ 𝑏 ⁄ ) √1-𝑣<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where 𝑀 = 2.9 is the mean orientation factor for the BCC structure polycrystalline matrix <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>, G is the shear modulus, 𝑣 is Poisson's ratio and b is the Burgers vector. Here, theoretical values of G (75.1 GPa) and 𝑣 (0.361) for the WNbMoTaV HEA can be used <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>.</p><p>𝑟̅ = 𝑟√2 3 ⁄ is the mean radius of a circular cross-section in a random plane for a spherical precipitate <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44]</ref>, where 𝑟 is the mean radius of the precipitate. The interspacing of a precipitate, λ, is calculated as follows <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">λ = 2𝑟̅ ( √ 𝜋 4𝑓 -1)<label>(6)</label></formula><p>where 𝑓 is the volume fraction of the precipitate. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">4</ref> summarizes the various parameters using to the equations ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">5</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_7">6</ref>). Both the volume fraction and mean radius of the oxide inclusions were measured by Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref>(a)-(c). This table also gives the C and O contents of the bulk specimens, as determined by CS-800 and ONH-2000 analyzers (ELTRA, Germany).</p><p>With increasing sintering temperature, the C content increased because of the faster diffusion of C from the graphite mold/punch in the SPS chamber, while the O content decreased because of a more reducing atmosphere in the presence of the graphite mold/punch <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46]</ref>.</p><p>Combining Equations ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">5</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_7">6</ref>), and using the parameters given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">4</ref>, the calculated value of 𝜎 𝑜𝑟 for the WNbMoTaV HEA ranged from 17 to 32 MPa. This weak contribution to yield strength from the oxide inclusions is attributed to their small volume fraction. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">6</ref> illustrates the relationship between the compressive yield strength and grain size of the WNbMoTaV HEA; the yield strength of the arc-melted and cast alloy is also shown for comparison <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> (marked as a green square). The calculated values of 𝜎 𝑜𝑟 for each bulk specimen were subtracted from the experimental yield strengths and are marked as blue squares in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">6</ref>. In terms of a contribution 𝜎 𝑖𝑠𝑠 , classical modes for the interstitial strengthening predict a 𝑐 1/2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53]</ref> or 𝑐 2/3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">55]</ref> dependence of 𝜎 𝑖𝑠𝑠 , where 𝑐 is a interstitial-solute concentration. Thus, 𝜎 𝑖𝑠𝑠 can be approximately given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">𝜎 𝑖𝑠𝑠 = Q𝑐 1/2<label>(7)</label></formula><p>or</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">𝜎 𝑖𝑠𝑠 = 𝑄𝑐 2/3 (8)</formula><p>where 𝑄 is a material constant. To calculate 𝜎 𝑖𝑠𝑠 of the WNbMoTaV HEA, we assumed three following assumptions. First, a given HEA composition has the same intrinsic strength (𝜎 0 ) and solid solution strength (𝜎 𝑠𝑠 ) irrespective of the processing route. Second, there is no interstitial strengthening on the yield strength of the as-cast WNbMoTaV HEA. Third, only carbon interstitials affects to the interstitial strengthening of the WNbMoTaV HEA, because oxygens are gathered in oxide inclusions. The value of 𝑐 in equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_8">7</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">8</ref>) can be borrowed from the C atomic percent in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">4</ref>. Given the first and second assumptions, after excluding the value of 𝜎 𝑜𝑟 and 𝜎 𝑖𝑠𝑠 , the difference in yield strength of the powder-processed and the arc-meting and casting processed WNbMoTaV alloy is only attributed by the contribution of 𝜎 𝑔𝑏 , which is traditionally rationalized by a Hall-Petch relationship.</p><p>Therefore, the author supposed that a slope between the green square and a square marked as '1' in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">6</ref>, and the other black squares marked as '2' and '3' in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">6</ref> have to be same, because the slope of the Hall-Petch relationship (Hall-Petch coefficient) is a material constant.</p><p>Since 𝜎 𝑖𝑠𝑠 is described as a function of c summarized in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">4</ref>, each values of 𝜎 𝑖𝑠𝑠 of the sintered specimens can be derived by a mathematical method with consideration of the supposition. As a result, the Q values in equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_8">7</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">8</ref>  The fabrication process, crystal structure and compressive mechanical properties of the WNbMoTaV HEA, as well as some typical refractory HEAs, are summarized in Table <ref type="table">6</ref>.</p><p>Additionally, the compressive yield strength and plastic strain of the refractory HEAs are detailed graphically in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">7</ref>.

The enhancement in yield strength may result from the combined effects of finer grain size, a homogeneous microstructure and interstitial strengthening.  for sintering at 1,500, 1,600 and 1,700°C, respectively. The differences in the plastic strain of the sintered specimens may be attributed to the interstitial C concentration of the sintered specimens, which is summarized in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">4</ref>. According to literature, interstitial solutes in BCC refractory metals cause significant brittleness to them <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>. With increase in sintering temperature, higher concentration of interstitial C has been introduced to the sintered WNbMoTaV HEA of BCC phase during the SPS process, resulting in the decrease of the plastic strain of the WNbMoTaV HEA. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Conclusion</head><p>The WNbMoTaV HEA with a BCC matrix was fabricated by MA and SPS powder metallurgical processes. Phase and microstructural characterization of the WNbMoTaV HEA powder indicated that 6 h of MA was the minimum milling time to mitigate contamination during the MA process while being adequate for the subsequent sintering process. The 6 hmilled powders and bulk WNbMoTaV HEA exhibited a single BCC solid solution phase, in accordance with theoretical criteria for the formation of a single solid solution. After SPS at 1,500-1,700°C, the bulk material had a relative density exceeding 99.5%. The microstructure of the bulk alloy consisted of a BCC matrix with a small volume fraction of oxide inclusions that were probably Ta 2 VO 6 . Therefore, this work established a route to a WNbMoTaV HEA with a homogeneous microstructure and high relative density.</p><p>The bulk material sintered at 1,500°C had a compressive yield strength and plastic strain of 2,612 MPa and 8.8%, respectively, when measured at room temperature. The outstanding mechanical properties of the WNbMoTaV HEA were attributed primarily to intrinsic solid solution strengthening, with the combined effect of grain boundary strengthening, interstitial solid solution strengthening and Orowan strengthening. The interstitial strengthening, which was introduced by the powder metallurgical process, particularly contributed to the strength and suggested that it is an important strengthening mechanism of HEAs in general. The Hall-Petch coefficient of the WNbMoTaV HEA was deduced to have a range of 1,462 ~ 1,774 MPa μm 0.5 depending on the contribution of the interstitial solid-solution strengthening. The compressive yield strength of WNbMoTaV HEA fabricated using MA and SPS was much higher than that of other reported HEAs processed by arc-melting and casting.       </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.

No peaks corresponding to Ta 2 VO 6 were observed for the bulk sintered at 1,700°C, which indicated a negligible volume fraction of this oxide.

The intercepts of the linear fitted lines of the Hall-Petch relationship are 1,078 MPa and 1,050 MPa, which are a combination of the intrinsic strength (𝜎 0 ), solid solution strength (𝜎 𝑠𝑠 ). In addition, the Hall-Petch coefficient of WNbMoTaV HEA, which is derived by the slope fitted lines, may be deduced to have a range of 1,462 ~ 1,774 MPa μm 0.5 , depending on the contribution of 𝜎 𝑖𝑠𝑠 . The contributions to the yield strength of the bulk specimens sintered at different temperature are summarized in Table5. As shown in Table5, the yield strength of the WNbMoTaV HEA was mainly governed by inherent solid solution strengthening and interstitial solid solution strengthening. The effect of interstitial solid solution strengthening of HEAs has rarely been reported. However, it is clearly an important strengthening mechanism for HEAs considering its significant contribution to the yield strength, which was introduced by the powder metallurgical process.</figDesc></figure>
