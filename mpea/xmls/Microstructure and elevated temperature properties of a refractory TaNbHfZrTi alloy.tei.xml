<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Compression properties of a refractory multicomponent alloy, Ta 20 Nb 20 Hf 20 Zr 20 Ti 20 , were determined in the temperature range of 296-1473 K and strain rate range of 10 -1 -10 -5 s -1 . The properties were correlated with the microstructure developed during compression testing. The alloy was produced by vacuum arc melting, and it was hot isostatically pressed (HIPd) and homogenized at 1473 K for 24 h prior to testing. It had a single-phase body-centered cubic structure with the lattice parameter a = 340.4 pm. The grain size was in the range of 100-200 lm. During compression at a strain rate of e 9 = 10 -3 s -1 , the alloy had the yield strength of 929 MPa at 296 K, 790 MPa at 673 K, 675 MPa at 873 K, 535 MPa at 1073 K, 295 MPa at 1273 K and 92 MPa at 1473 K. Continuous strain hardening and good ductility (e C 50%) were observed in the temperature range from 296 to 873 K. Deformation at T = 1073 K and e 9 C 10 -3 s -1 was accompanied by intergranular cracking and cavitation, which was explained by insufficient dislocation and diffusion mobility to accommodate grain boundary sliding activated at this temperature. The intergranular cracking and cavitation disappeared with an increase in the deformation temperature to 1273 and 1473 K or a decrease in the strain rate to *10 -5 s -1 . At these high temperatures and/or low-strain rates the alloy deformed homogeneously and showed steady-state flow at a nearly constant flow stress. Partial dynamic recrystallization, leading to formation of fine equiaxed grains near grain boundaries, was observed in the specimens deformed at 1073 and 1273 K and completed dynamic recrystallization was observed at 1473 K.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Metallic alloys with superior mechanical and functional properties at elevated temperatures remain in high demand for the aerospace industry. Operating temperatures of currently used Ni-based superalloys are reaching the theoretical limits, controlled by incipient melting temperatures in the range of 1440-1540 K. New metallic materials with higher melting points, such as refractory molybdenum (Mo) and niobium (Nb) alloys, are examined as alternatives by academic and industrial groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Refractory metals and alloys are a group of metallic materials with melting points above 2123 K. High-temperature strength and creep resistance are the key properties of these alloys, since considerable alloy softening generally occurs at temperatures above *0.5-0.6 T m , where T m is the absolute melting temperature. At the same time, poor low-temperature ductility, poor oxidation resistance at elevated temperatures and their high density limit the range of applications of many refractory alloys.</p><p>Recently a new strategy for development of high strength and high-temperature alloys, so-called multiprincipal-element or high-entropy alloys, has been proposed <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. In these new alloys the configurational entropy of disordered solid solution is maximized by mixing a large number of the alloying elements (generally five or higher) at near-equimolar concentrations. The high entropy of mixing stabilizes more ductile disordered solid solution phases relative to possible intermetallic phases. This concept has shown merit with the production of several experimental alloy compositions with face center cubic (FCC) and/or body center cubic (BCC) crystal structures and favorable combinations of strength and ductility <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. In particular, two refractory high-entropy alloys, Ta 25 Nb 25 Mo 25 W 25 <ref type="bibr">(TaNbMoW)</ref> and Ta 20 Nb 20 V 20 Mo 20 W 20 (TaNbVMoW) were recently produced <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>, which had a single-phase BCC structure, high hardness of 4.5 and 5.3 GPa, respectively, and very high yield strength (r 0.2 ) in the temperature range from 296 to 1873 K. For example, r 0.2 of 405 and 477 MPa at 1873 K were reported for the TaNbMoW and TaNbVMoW alloys, respectively. Unfortunately, these two refractory alloys have a high density (13.8 g/cm 3 for TaNbMoW and 12.4 g/cm 3 for TaNbVMoW) and are brittle at room temperature. Replacement of heavier W, Mo, and V with lighter Hf, Zr, and Ti allowed formulation of a new refractory alloy, Ta 20 Nb 20 Hf 20 Zr 20 Ti 20 <ref type="bibr">(TaNbHfZrTi)</ref>, with a reduced density of q = 9.94 g/cm 3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. In the cast and HIP condition, the TaNbHfZrTi alloy had a BCC crystal structure with the lattice parameter a = 340.4 ± 0.5 pm and it showed high-compression yield strength (r 0.2 = 929 MPa), considerable strain hardening and excellent ductility (e [ 50%) at room temperature <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. Unfortunately, elevated temperature properties of this alloy were not reported. In this article, the effects of temperature (in the range from 296 to 1473 K) and strain rate (in the range from 10 -1 s -1 to 10 -5 s -1 ) on compression properties and microstructure of the TaNbHfZrTi alloy were studied.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental procedures</head><p>The TaNbHfZrTi alloy was prepared by vacuum arc melting of the equimolar mixtures of the corresponding elements. Titanium, zirconium, and hafnium were in the form of 3.175 mm diameter slugs with purities of 99.98, 99.95, and 99.9%, respectively. Niobium and tantalum were in the form of 1.0 and 2.0 mm wires, and their purity was 99.95 and 99.9%, respectively. Details of the preparation of this alloy by vacuum arc melting are given elsewhere <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. The prepared button was about 8 mm thick and had shiny surfaces, indicating no oxidation during vacuum arc melting. The actual alloy composition determined with the use of inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES), is given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. The cast alloy was hot isostatically pressed (HIPd) at 1473 K and 207 MPa for 1 h and then vacuum annealed at 1473 K for 24 h.</p><p>Cylindrical specimens for compression testing were electric-discharge machined from the HIPd and annealed alloy. The specimen axis was perpendicular to the button surface, which was in contact with the copper plate during arc melting. The specimen surfaces were mechanically polished and the compression faces of the specimens were paralleled and lubricated with boron nitride (for elevated temperature tests). The specimens were *3.8 mm in diameter and * 5.7 mm in height. Compression tests were conducted at temperatures 673, 873, 1073, 1273 and 1473 K in a computer-controlled Instron (Instron, Norwood, MA) mechanical testing machine outfitted with a Brew vacuum furnace and silicon carbide dies. Before each test, the furnace chamber was evacuated to 10 -6 torr. The test specimen was then heated to the test temperature at a heating rate of *20 K/min and soaked at the temperature for 15 min under 5 N controlled load, and then compressed to a 50% height reduction. To study the effect of temperature on the deformation behavior, a constant ramp speed that corresponded to an initial strain rate of 10 -3 s -1 was used. Room temperature testing was conducted at the same loading conditions but in air, and a thin Teflon foil was used between the compression faces and silicon carbide dies to reduce friction. To study the effect of strain rate on the flow stress at 1023 K, constant ramp speeds of 5.7 9 10 -1 , 5.7 9 10 -2 , 5.7 9 10 -3 , 5.7 9 10 -4 , and 5.7 9 10 -5 mm/s, corresponding to initial strain rate range from 10 -5 s -1 to 10 -1 s -1 , were used. The deformation of all specimens was video-recorded and an optical setup was used to measure strain versus load. The microstructure was analyzed with the use of a scanning electron microscope (SEM) equipped with backscatter electron (BSE), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) detectors.</p></div>

The SYS values of three other recently developed high-entropy cast alloys, high-strength refractory TaNbMoW and TaNbVMoW <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> and a ductile CrCoCuFeNiAl 0.5 <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, are also given in this figure for comparison. The SYS of the TaNbHfZrTi alloy is about 86% higher at 296 K and about 50% higher at 1273 K than the SYS of the CrCoCuFeNiAl 0.5 alloy. In the temperature range of 296-1073 K, the SYS of the TaNbHfZrTi alloy is also superior to the SYS of the TaNbMoW alloy. However, the TaNbVMoW is stronger than other three alloys at temperatures from 296 to 1873 K and the TaNbMoW alloy is stronger than TaNbHfZrTi and CrCoCuFeNiAl 0.5 at temperatures C1273 K. The rapid drop in the yield strength of the TaNbHfZrTi alloy beyond T = 1073 K, compared with the TaNbMoW and TaNbVMoW alloys is apparently due to a much lower melting temperature of the first alloy <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>. A rapid decrease in strength of metallic alloys is known to generally occur at temperatures above T R * 0.5-0.6 T m due to intensification of diffusion-related processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>.</p></div>

A rather uniform deformation, with a very small specimen barreling and no evidence of strain localization, occurs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6a</ref>). Deformed grains are elongated in the directions of plastic flow (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6b</ref>). Higher magnification images reveal fine lamellae inside the grains (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6c</ref>). Complimentary electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> suggests that these lamellae are likely the mixture of distorted deformation twins and shear bands.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7</ref> illustrates the microstructure of a specimen deformed at 673 K. The deformation is localized in a shear band propagating from the left top side to the right bottom side of the compressed sample (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7a</ref>). Heavy deformation of grains inside the shear band is clearly seen at a higher magnification in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7b</ref>. The shear bands are also developed during deformation at 873 K, however, the strain localization is less pronounced. Instead of one, two crossing shear bands form at this temperature (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8a</ref>) and cracks develop in one of the shear bands after 50% compression strain (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8b</ref>). Deformation twins are observed in specimens deformed at 673 and 873 K and micro-cracks are occasionally seen at grain boundaries intersecting the twins (Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7c,</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8c</ref>).</p><p>Extensive deformation-induced intergranular cavities and cracks are observed in a specimen deformed at 1073 K (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">9a,</ref><ref type="figure">b</ref>). Higher number density and larger size of these cavities at the side edges of the specimen are likely associated with higher stress concentrations in these regions. No deformation twins are observed at this and higher temperatures. Instead, nanometer-size particles/grains are formed along grain boundaries (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">9c</ref>).</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">10</ref> shows the microstructures of specimens after 50% compression strain at 1273 and 1473 K. No shear bands, deformation twins or intergranular cracks are observed in these specimens (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">10a</ref>). Higher magnification images of the specimen deformed at 1273 K show darker and lighter spots and/or curvy bands inside the deformed grains (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">10b</ref>) and a fine-grained structure formed near the grain boundaries (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">10b,</ref><ref type="figure">c</ref>). The new grains are equiaxed and their size is about 1-2 lm at 1273 K. The dark/light spot/band contrasts inside the deformed grains are identified using the EBSD analysis to be likely caused by different electron channeling conditions from these slightly misoriented grain regions <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref>. Effect of strain rate on microstructure after deformation at T = 1073 K SEM backscatter images of a TaNbHfZrTi alloy specimen after 50% compression strain at 1073 K and _ e = 10 -2 s -1 are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">11</ref>. The deformed specimen looks somewhat similar to the specimen compressed at the same temperature with _ e = 10 -3 s -1 (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">9</ref>). In particular, cracks and cavities are developed at grain boundaries, especially at those oriented about 40-50°to the compression direction (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">11a</ref>). Higher magnification images show new fine grains/particles developed in highly deformed regions near the grain boundaries of the deformed grains, as well as elongated sub-grains inside these deformed grains (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">11b,</ref><ref type="figure">c</ref>).</p><p>A decrease in the strain rate to _ e = 10 -4 s -1 leads to a considerable transformation of the fracture mechanism (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">12</ref>). Instead of wedge-shaped cracks typical at higher strain rates (see Figs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11)</ref>, mainly spherical cavities are formed at and near grain boundaries in the specimen deformed at _ e = 10 -4 s -1 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">12a,</ref><ref type="figure">b</ref>). Wedge-shaped cracks are also present at triple grain junctions, but these cracks are much smaller and they do not propagate much along grain boundaries. A nearly equiaxed subgrain structure develops inside the deformed grains. New fine grains and lens-shaped cavities at grain boundaries, as well as fine precipitation along subgrain boundaries, are clearly seen in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">12c</ref>. The X-ray and SEM/EDS/EBSD techniques used in this study were not capable to identify the chemistry and crystal structure of these second-phase nano-precipitates due to their very small size and low number-density. Transmission electron microscopy is needed for the detailed analysis of these precipitates, which is beyond of the scope of this article.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>At least three temperature regions with different deformation behavior of the TaNbHfZrTi alloy can be clearly identified. In the temperature range of 296-873 K, the alloy demonstrates strong strain hardening, good ductility and deformation twin activity. At 1073 K it exhibits heavy cavitation at grain boundaries, formation of very fine grains along grain boundaries and precipitation of second-phase nano-particles at grain and subgrain boundaries. During deformation at 1273 and 1473 K, the alloy shows a rapid drop in the stress after yielding followed by steady-state flow, formation of new grains near grain boundaries and a subgrain structure inside the original grains at 1273 K, and dynamic recrystallization with the formation of fine, equiaxed grain structure at 1473 K.</p><p>Behavior at T = 296-873 K Typically, five independent slip systems have to be activated to accommodate macroscopic deformation of a polycrystalline alloy. In BCC alloys, to which the studied alloy belongs <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, deformation by twinning generally occurs under conditions at which the slip systems and/or dislocation mobility are restricted <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. Under these conditions, twinning may compensate for the lack of independent slip systems and thus support deformation and delay fracture of polycrystalline aggregates. One may therefore suggest that the activation of deformation twinning contributes to the good ductility of the TaNbHfZrTi alloy in the temperature range of 296-873 K. The high yield strength and strain hardening observed in this temperature range can be due to solid solution strengthening <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, an increase in the number density of immobile dislocations and an effective decrease in the grain size by formation of twin boundaries and shear bands <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>. Whereas dislocation motion is highly sensitive to temperature and the critical resolved shear stress for dislocation glide decreases rapidly with an increase in temperature, the stress to activate twinning has much weaker temperature dependence, mainly through the temperature dependence of the shear modulus of the alloy. Taking this into account and noting that twinning was not observed during compression at temperatures C1073 K, one may conclude that the critical twinning stress for this alloy, r ctw is somewhere above 600 MPa. It is worth noting that no twinning and very low ductility were observed in the BCC TaNbMoW and TaNbVMoW alloys, which had r 0.2 of 1058 and 1246 MPa, respectively, at room temperature <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. Such different deformation behavior of these two alloys from the behavior of the TaNbHfZrTi alloy can be explained by their higher stiffness. Indeed, the shear modulus of TaNbMoW and TaNbVMoW alloys is estimated to be *98 and 88 GPa, respectively, while that of the TaNbHfZrTi alloy is *42 GPa <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. Assuming that r ctw depends on the composition mainly through the shear modulus and assigning r ctw = 650 MPa for the TaNbHfZrTi alloy, one may estimate r ctw = 1517 MPa for the TaNbMoW alloy and r ctw = 1362 MPa for the TaNbVMoW alloy. These estimates show that r ctw is much higher than r 0.2 for both W-containing alloys, thus explaining inactivity of deformation twinning and brittleness in these two alloys.</p><p>Behavior at T = 1073 K Extensive cavitation at grain boundaries, as well as grain boundary cracks often emanating from triple grain junctions, observed in the TaNbHfZrTi alloy deformed at 1073 K and high-strain rates (_ e C 10 -3 s -1 , see Figs. 9 and 11), are likely to be indications of initiation of grain boundary sliding, which is not yet supported by sufficient dislocation mobility and diffusion. It is worth noting that the highest volume fraction of cavities is observed at the side regions of the compressed specimens, which experience the highest tension and shear stresses. Grain boundary sliding results in formation and growth of wedge-shaped cracks at ledges and at triple grain junctions along favorably oriented (about 40-50°to the compression direction) grain boundaries (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">9a</ref>).</p><p>The extensive cavitation indicates that the dislocation mobility and diffusion activity are not sufficient to accommodate the grain boundary sliding and relieve stress concentrations at the sliding grain boundaries at these temperature and strain-rate conditions. The distinct tearand wedge-like morphologies of the cavities in the specimens deformed at _ e = 10 -2 and 10 -3 s -1 suggest that growth of the cavities formed along the inclined grain boundaries occurs by grain separation under the normal tension stresses, and it is unlikely that diffusion-controlled cavity growth occurs. Formation of very fine new grains along the boundaries of deformed grains is an additional indication of the presence of high-internal stresses and high-dislocation density at the grain boundaries. It is quite possible that as soon as these fresh fine grains are formed, deformation and fracture localize in these fine-grained regions along the initially present grain boundaries. Second-phase nano-particles precipitated near grain boundaries at this temperature may also take part in the grain boundary cavitation, as cracks and voids can be initiated at the particle-matrix interfaces during propagation of shear along grain boundaries. Such cavitation behavior is not unique. Some other alloys show similar cavitation and drop in ductility at intermediate temperatures (generally around *0.5 T m ), which are close to the equicohesive temperature, due to initiation of grain boundary sliding not yet accommodated by diffusion processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref>.</p><p>A decrease in the strain rate to _ e B 10 -4 s -1 considerably reduces grain boundary cavitation and makes small cavities more round-shaped (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">12</ref>). It is likely that the rates of diffusion and deformation processes at grain boundaries become comparable at these low-strain rates and the local stress field is not sufficient to control cavitation. Instead, mainly diffusion-controlled cavity growth occurs.</p><p>Behavior at T = 1273-1473 K Cavitation at grain boundaries disappears when the deformation temperature is increased above 1073 K and no cracks or porosity are observed in the alloy deformed at 1273 and 1473 K (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">10</ref>). Dynamic recrystallization occurs along grain boundaries at 1273 K and in a whole sample at 1473 K. It is expected that the diffusion-controlled processes such as dislocation mobility and dynamic recrystallization are sufficient at these temperatures to effectively reduce stress concentrations and prevent formation of cavities at grain boundaries <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36]</ref>. At the same time, characteristic channeling contrasts observed inside deformed at 1273 K grains spotlight the presence of internal stresses inside these grains. Fortunately, the absence of second-phase particles offers no choice for transgranular fracture at these temperatures.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Effect of strain rate on deformation behavior</head><p>The analysis of the deformation behavior and microstructure/fracture features clearly indicates that the mechanisms controlling the deformation and fracture of the alloy at 1073 K dramatically change when the strain rate decreases below 10 -3 s -1 . Indeed, the change in the deformation mechanism with a decrease in _ e below 10 -3 s -1 is clearly identified by an abrupt decrease in the stress exponent n (Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">1</ref>) from n = 140 to n = 4.5 for r 0.2 and from n = 43 to n = 3.0 for r 10 (see Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>). The very weak dependence of the flow stress on strain rate at high-strain rate values can also be seen in Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>, where the deformation curves obtained at different strain rates are shown. The high n values, indicating a very low strain-rate sensitivity of the flow stress, typically correspond to thermally activated dislocation glide and originate from the strong exponential dependence of the dislocation velocity on the applied stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. In this regime, that generally occurs at high strain rates and/or low temperatures, a small increase in the flow stress results in a large increase in the dislocation velocity and, respectively, strain rate. The stress exponent value n = 4.5 is normally observed during hightemperature dislocation creep, when the dislocation climb is the rate-controlling mechanism <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref>. Finally, n = 3.0 is generally observed for the solute-drag controlled dislocation glide during high-temperature deformation of solid solutions <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. Grain boundary sliding accommodated by dislocation climb/glide can also lead to low n values varying from n = 2 (when grain boundary sliding is the rate-controlling mechanism) to n = 4.5-5 (when the sliding is controlled by dislocation glide/climb) <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref>. Cavitation, observed at 1073 K and described above, starts to develop at strains above 10% and thus should not have effect on r 0.2 and r 10 . Taking into account that a decrease in strain rate affects deformation behavior somewhat similar to an increase in temperature (this is generally described through a temperature-compensated strain-rate e exp(Q/RT), where Q is the activation energy and R is the gas constant <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36]</ref>), one may suggest from this analysis that at _ e B 10 -3 s -1 and T C 1073 K the mechanisms controlling flow stress of the alloy are likely the dislocation climb, solute-drag controlled dislocation glide, and grain boundary sliding. All these mechanisms are diffusion controlled, thus indicating that diffusion becomes sufficient to accommodate deformation at these conditions.</p><p>The regression analysis of the experimental data shows that the stress dependence of the Z parameter at T C 1073 K and _ e B 10 -3 s -1 can be described as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">Z _ e exp Q=RT ð Þ ¼ Ar n<label>ð2Þ</label></formula><p>where n = 3.3 ± 0.3, Q = 226 ± 20 kJ/mol and A = (43.0 ± 3.4) 9 10 -3 MPa -n s -1 . An excellent fit (R 2 = 0.995) of Eq. 2 to the experimental flow stress values is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">13</ref>. The obtained value for the activation energy can be compared with the activation energies for self-diffusion of BCC elements, Q Ta = 460 kJ/mol <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>; Q Nb = 310-340 kJ/mol <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>; Q Hf = 162-183 kJ/mol <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>; Q Zr = 109-159 kJ/mol <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>, 126 kJ/mol <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>, 272 kJ/mol [ <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>, p. 492], 169-278 kJ/mol <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>; and Q Ti = 130-260 kJ/mol <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44]</ref>. Although the diffusion of the alloying elements in the multi-component TaNbHfZrTi alloy can be quite different from the self-diffusion, one can speculate that Hf, Zr, and Ti diffuse much faster than Ta and Nb in this alloy and thus the activation energy of the plastic flow is likely controlled by diffusion of these (Hf, Zr, and/or Ti) elements. Acceleration of the diffusion processes at T C 1073 K and _ e B 10 -3 s -1 is also reflected in changing the fracture mechanism from crack propagation at lower temperatures and higher strain rates to void formation and growth at higher temperatures and lower strain rates.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>Compression properties of a new refractory multi-component alloy, TaNbHfZrTi, were determined in the temperature range of 296-1473 K and strain rate range of 10 -1 -10 -5 s -1 . The properties were correlated with the microstructure developed during compression testing. Three temperature regions with different deformation behavior were identified.</p><p>In the temperature range of 296-873 K, the alloy showed temperature-independent strain hardening, deformation twinning and shear band formation. High yield During compression at 1073 K, heavy cavitation and formation of very fine equiaxed grains along the boundaries of deformed grains were observed at strain rates C10 -3 s -1 . No deformation twinning was detected at this temperature. The grain boundary cavitation sufficiently reduced and large notched cracks replaced with finer round-shaped pores at strain rates \10 -3 s -1 . The cavitation was explained by initiation of grain boundary sliding, which created stress concentrations at grain boundary ledges and triple grain junctions due to insufficient dislocation and diffusion mobility at this temperature.</p><p>During deformation at 1273-1473 K, the alloy showed a rapid drop in flow stress after yielding followed by the steady-state flow. No cavitations or cracks were observed in specimens compressed at least up to 50% in this temperature range. Partial (at 1273 K) or complete (at 1473 K) dynamic recrystallization occurred during deformation was likely the process responsible for the strain softening and steady-state flow at these temperatures.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1 Engineering stress vs. engineering strain compression curves of the TaNbHfZrTi alloy at different temperatures</figDesc></figure>

In spite annealing at 1473 K for 24 h, the element micro-segregation typical to the as-cast condition was still noted inside the grains. In particular, the centers of grains were slightly (*2-3%) enriched with Ta and Nb and the regions near grain boundaries were slightly enriched with Hf and Zr, while Ti was almost homogeneously distributed between these regions. The variations in grain sizes did not affect mechanical behavior and the top and bottom parts of the samples showed similar compression behavior (see below).</figDesc><graphic coords="4,308.93,427.09,232.80,249.12" type="bitmap" /></figure>
