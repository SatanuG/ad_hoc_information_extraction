<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Refractory high entropy alloys (HEA) are promising materials for high temperature applications. This work presents investigations of the room temperature tensile mechanical properties of selected 3 and 4 elements medium entropy alloys (MEA) derived from the HfNbTaTiZr system. Tensile testing was combined with fractographic and microstructure analysis, using scanning electron microscope (SEM), wavelength dispersive spectroscope (WDS) and X-Ray powder diffraction (XRD). The 5 element HEA alloy HfNbTaTiZr exhibits the best combination of strength and elongation while 4 and 3 element MEAs have lower strength. Some of them are ductile, some of them brittle, depending on microstructure. Simultaneous presence of Ta and Zr in the alloy resulted in a significant reduction of ductility caused by reduction of the BCC phase content. Precipitation of Ta rich particles on grain boundaries reduces further the maximum elongation to failure down to zero values.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>High entropy alloys (HEAs) attract attention of a growing number of scientists and researchers. A concept of mixing of 5 or more elements in equimolar or near equimolar concentrations is used in order to explore central regions of multicomponent alloy phase space <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. This approach is driven by possibility to get stable solid solution microstructure of the alloy with favourable mechanical properties (high strength and good ductility) as well as other physical properties, for example, good corrosion resistance <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Microstructure stability shall be provided by high configurational entropy of the system, supposing random arrangement of alloying elements <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref>. Although increased configurational entropy may in principle stabilize solid solution its stabilizing effect is usually found insufficient to counteract driving forces for formation of intermetallic phases <ref type="bibr">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref>.</p><p>Since the pioneering work of Yeh <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, original concept has been evolved and widened. The term HEA is connected mainly with approach utilizing high configurational entropy to get single phase solid solution of multiple elements. Multiple principal element alloys (MPEA) represent a broader approach when the main motivation is exploring of a vast composition space of multi-principal element alloys without primary concern about the magnitude of the configurational entropy <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. MPEAs with multi-phase microstructures are denoted complex concentrated alloys (CCA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</p><p>Different elements are used to fabricate HEAs. Although the number of possible 4 or 5 elements combinations is enormous five basic metallic HEA groups can be distinguished: FCC HEAs based on the Cantor alloy, BCC refractory metal HEAs, light element HEAs, HCP HEAs and precious functional HEAs <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Ceramic HEAs have been established as well <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>.</p><p>Our attention was attracted by the refractory HEA group, which is composed of elements from IV, V and VI groups of the periodic table of elements <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. These elements are characterized by prevailing good mutual miscibility and high melting points. The melting point of titanium (1668 • C) is the lowest among them. Therefore HEAs composed of these elements are intended for high temperature applications. Moreover some of these elements are biocompatible <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Therefore some of these alloys can be attractive for bioimplant related materials research. Note that β-Ti alloys used in bioimplant research are usually composed of this group of elements <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. Several biocompatible HEAs have been already studied <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. Also, hard ceramic composites were produced from the metals from IV, V and VI groups of the periodic table <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</p><p>Original definition of HEAs with single phase solid solution microstructure and good room temperature mechanical properties, especially ductility, is beneficial also for use in human medicine. Inspiration can be found also in other materials used for production of bioimplants which are used or have been used in other parts of material research, for example, TiAl6V4 in aerospace, CoCrMo in aero engines.</p><p>Our first attempt in research of HEAs was therefore related to HfNbTaTiZr refractory metal alloy <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. Our research was inspired by Senkov <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> and confirmed our expectations. Ingots produced by vacuum arc melting possessed single phase solid solution microstructure, with a high room temperature tensile strength and ductility.</p><p>Some of the elements used in the HfNbTaTiZr alloy are very similar to each other with very similar chemical behaviour; Nb is chemically similar to Ta and Zr to Hf. Therefore a question has emerged whether it is necessary to use all of these elements in order to get random solid solution and good mechanical properties (high strength and sufficient ductility).</p><p>The design of the present experiment was as follows. First, we reduced the original HfNbTaTiZr alloy system by removing Hf, which is almost identical to Zr from the chemical point of view, then we distracted Ta, which is very similar to Nb; thus getting NbTiZr alloy with equiatomic concentrations. Then we produced also other 3 element combinations containing Ti, namely TaTiZr and NbTaTi. Based on the observed results; 4 element alloys containing Ti and Ta with different Nb to Zr ratio were produced as well to explore the influence of chemical composition on elongation.</p><p>NbTaTiZr <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> and NbTiZr <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr">21]</ref> studies have already been reported. No reports about TaTiZr and NbTaTi were found in literature.</p><p>One can notice that set of the produced element combinations is not complete. The motivation for element selection was as follows. Titanium was used in all combination because it is element with the lowest density. Hafnium was not used since it is very reactive in ambient atmosphere and it is hard to get Hf free of impurities. Both hafnium and tantalum are high density and high price element; thus less suitable for practical use.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Materials and Methods</head><p>Experimental alloys were prepared by vacuum arc melting in water cooled copper crucible. Chemical purity of inserted elements was 99.9%. Final cast ingot has approximately 100 mm in length, 30 mm in width, 10 mm in height and 400 g in weight. Casting was performed 8x times and flipped for each melt to mix the elements thoroughly and suppress chemical heterogeneity. All investigated alloys were prepared at the same equipment under the same conditions. Nor HIP, nor other heat treatment was applied to the cast material.</p><p>Tensile test bodies 5 mm in diameter and 25 mm of measured length were strained with the strain rate of 2 × 10 -4 s -1 using Instron 1185 testing machine equipped with video extensometer.</p><p>Metallographic sections perpendicular to the length of the casting were prepared. Vickers hardness HV30 was measured using Zwick ZHU 250 Topline universal testing machine.</p><p>Fractography analysis of broken specimen surfaces was carried out on a scanning electron microscope (JEOL JSM 7600F).</p><p>Microstructure was examined by scanning electron microscope (FEI Quanta 200F) equipped with wavelength dispersive X-ray spectroscope (WDS) for local chemical composition analysis.</p><p>In order to determine phase composition and structures of phases in the alloys, powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) analysis was performed. A Bruker D8 Discover diffractometer, CuKα radiation and 1D detector were used. Lattice parameters and phase composition were determined by Rietveld analysis of PXRD diffraction patterns using TOPAS V5 code <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</p><p>Ab-initio quantum Monte Carlo (MC) simulation was performed to obtain atomic configuration of the 5 element HfNbTaTiZr alloy. Hf, Nb, Ta, Ti, Zr ions were distributed randomly in equimolar concentration into a 250 atom BCC supercell. This initial state was relaxed with respect to ion positions until minimum of the total free energy was reached. The equilibrium configuration corresponding to minimum free energy was obtained using a Metropolis MC algorithm at 300 K (room temperature). The details of the simulation and more complete results will be published elsewhere.</p></div>

Dominant source of peak broadening is chemical heterogeneity, that is, local changes of lattice parameter due to spatial variations of chemical composition.    </p></div>

It is important to investigate the question of existence of 2 or more BCC phases in our alloys.

All our alloys satisfy these two conditions but some of them are not single phase. Thus binary diagram analysis is needed.</p><p>Mixing enthalpies of element pairs relevant to the investigated alloys is shown in Table <ref type="table">6</ref>. Some mixing enthalpies are zero (Ti-Zr, Ti-Hf, Zr-Hf and Ta-Nb -pairs of elements from the same group) or almost zero (Ti-Ta, Ti-Nb), which is ideal for solid solution forming. Other mixing enthalpies are little bit higher (Ta-Zr, Ta-Hf, Nb-Zr, Nb-Hf -pairs from different but neighbouring groups). Above zero mixing enthalpies can cause existence of miscibility gaps in respective binary diagrams. Binary equilibrium phase diagrams of pairs with higher mixing enthalpies are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">11</ref>. No intermetallic phases are present but large miscibility gaps can be found. Although in case of Ta-Zr diagram miscibility gap is in the range between 800 • C and 1780 • C, see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_19">10a</ref>, we found two BCC phases at room temperature.</p><p>two BCC phases and HCP was detected in a HfNbTaTiZr specimen annealed at 500 • C for 100 h.

No clear explanation of this phenomenon was given <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. Comparing experimental details of the present study with Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> one can recognize that dimensions of ingots were different. Ingots of alloys studied in the present work were larger and thereby solidifies and cools slower than ingots in Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. Therefore NbTaTiZr alloy containing 100% of the BCC1 phase reported in Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> was likely due to higher cooling rate; while in the present work the same alloy exhibits a mixture of BCC1 and BCC2 phases, see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">4</ref>. On the contrary in Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> the NbTaTiZr is referred as brittle, we measured 6.4% elongation, see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">3</ref>, however, fracture mechanism has changed from transgranular with ductile dimples to intergranular, see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>. Different interstitials element content may cause the difference in deformation of nominally same alloy.</p><p>In this study we use the same furnace and the same size of ingots in case of all investigated alloys. Therefore it is solely the effect of Ta + Zr content what affects the stability of the BCC1 phase.

Combination of BCC and HCP phases were detected, at specific conditions (longer annealing temperatures and longer times) Ta rich BCC and Zr rich HCP phase precipitates were formed. Similarity of the microstructures and phases suggests that these effects have similar origin, namely Ta+Zr content, partial decomposition of the BCC1 phase to the BCC2 because of relatively high Ta-Zr mixing enthalpy and resulting miscibility gap.</p><p>The 5 element HfNbTaTiZr alloy was studied in Refs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36]</ref>.

Ingots used in Refs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36]</ref> were smaller compared to that prepared in the present work, thus gaining higher cooling rate.

The MC simulation revealed segregation of Ta in the equilibrium state of the HfNbTaTiZr alloy. This supports the idea of Ta + Zr destabilizing HEAs also during ageing annealing. Thus single phase BCC1 structure is metastable in the 5 element HfNbTaTiZr HEA alloy at room temperature and can be preserved after high temperature annealing by rapid cooling.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusions</head><p>Investigations of mechanical properties and microstructure of different MEAs derived from the HfNbTaTiZr alloy system has been performed. It has been shown that ductility is significantly reduced by simultaneous presence of Ta and Zr in the alloy, which leads to reduction of the BCC1 phase content. These elements segregate during solidifying. Because of the miscibility gap in the Ta-Zr equilibrium phase diagram two BCC phases are found after cooling to room temperature. Clear correlation between the BCC1 phase content and the total elongation to failure of the alloy was found. Precipitation of Ta rich precipitates on grain boundaries reduces the elongation to almost zero values. No correlation was found between the tensile mechanical properties and microstructure related parameters in investigated set of alloys. The 5 element HEA alloy exhibits the best combination of strength and elongation. 4 and 3 element MEAs have lower strength to various extent. Some of them are ductile (NbTaTiZr, NbTaTi, NbTiZr) but some of them are brittle (TaTiZr, Nb 1.5 TaTiZr 0.5 , Nb 0.5 TaTiZr 1.5 ) depending on microstructure.</p><p>Obtained results on microstructure stability and related mechanical properties can be useful also for long term aging annealing of HEA alloys.
