<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Refractory high entropy alloys (RHEAs) are candidates for replacing conventional refractory alloys. In this work, twelve new RHEAs were selected and produced. The phases present in the as-cast and heat-treated conditions were characterized and compared with CALPHAD simulations and empirical parameters. Here we propose a new interpretation for the two widely used  and  empirical parameters. In this work, they are shown to be inaccurate when applied to a large group of RHEAs, but can be a powerful alloy design tool if applied on specific subsystems of alloys. Experimentally, chromium-containing alloys are shown to form Laves phases, especially when the lattice distortion () is high, while aluminum-containing alloys are shown to form the A15 phase upon heat-treatment, due to their highly negative enthalpy of mixing (H mix ). In addition to microstructural characterization, mechanical properties of these alloys via hardness testing were assessed. A poor correlation was observed between the hardness and the atomic size and elastic modulus mismatch in these single-phase BCC RHEAs, suggesting that core structure of the screw dislocations is a crucial parameter in understanding the strength of these alloys.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>High Entropy Alloys (HEAs) or Complex Concentrated Alloys (CCAs), are typically mixtures of 3 to 6 elemental constituents in near equimolar concentrations <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>. This creates a vastly unexplored composition and property landscape. Based on the hundreds of HEAs that have been studied to date <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, these alloys display interesting combinations of mechanical and functional properties in comparison to conventional alloys <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref>.

These alloys are primarily composed of mixtures of high melting point refractory elements, typically from groups 4-6 in the periodic table, to give the alloy increased temperature stability, along with other elements such as aluminum (Al) to deliver a balance of properties (oxidation resistance, ductility, low density) <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. The microstructures of these alloys are usually composed of a body centered cubic (BCC) structure, sometimes present with other phases such as the B2 phase <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref>,</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T</head><p>Laves phases <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> and simple hexagonal close packed (HCP) phases <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref>. These alloys are designed to have elevated solidus and liquidus temperatures.</p><p>These alloys are envisioned for structural applications, in which four properties are desirable, namely strength, formability, oxidation resistance and low density (especially for aerospace applications). It is well known that conventional refractory alloys <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> display limitations in one or more of these areas, primarily due to poor lower temperature ductility and high temperature oxidation resistance. RHEAs display promising mechanical properties over a wide temperature range <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. This, combined with thermal stability <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>, results in promising high temperature performance. RHEAs containing Al and Cr are of special interest, given the potential for better oxidation resistance <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41]</ref> of Al-and Cr-containing alloys <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43]</ref> and the lower density of Al-containing alloys <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. Although the oxidation behavior improves, if large contents of these elements are added, secondary phases that are detrimental to the mechanical properties tend to appear <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>. In particular, ductility tends to be a problem for RHEAs. The properties of a material are dictated by the phases present, making the properties of each individual phase and the composite behavior important. Therefore, accurate ways of determining temperature dependent phase stabilities for given compositions is paramount for alloy development. Several models exist in the literature for predicting the phase equilibria of RHEAs <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>; these models can be divided into empirical parameters, CALPHAD simulations and first principles studies.</p><p>First-principles phase prediction methods are becoming increasingly popular <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48]</ref>. They tend to be accurate at lower temperatures (close to 0K), due to a better accuracy of enthalpic effects over entropic ones <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>. For this reason, these studies tend to be more fundamental and the correlation to experimental results can be less straightforward.</p><p>Empirical parameters are widely employed, and consist of simple parameters that can be calculated using fundamental properties of the alloying elements, such as atomic size or Miedema enthalpy of mixing <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46]</ref>. Single values for each parameter are obtained for a given composition and can be compared to those calculated for other alloys. Some of these parameters exhibit distinct threshold values, above or below which the alloy has a high probability to be single-phase. The most common parameters are the delta (, omega (and delta chi empirical parameters. In this work,  and  are reinterpreted for RHEAs, and the findings provide insight into more effective alloy design.</p><p>Thermodynamic simulations by CALPHAD <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> are another widely used method. Since these simulations depend heavily on thermodynamic databases for calculations, the predictions can be very accurate if the database is well described. One of the major strengths of the CALPHAD methodology <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51]</ref> is that the phase equilibria of multi-component systems can be described by combined descriptions from the relevant binary and ternary subsystems, making the CALPHAD approach a good option for HEA development. In general, the CALPHAD predictions tend to be more accurate at high temperatures <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>, where entropic effects tend to dominate. A challenging step then becomes developing accurate databases, since a large number of subsystems need to be assessed for a multi-component prediction. For this reason, most commercial databases that are typically used in published work need to be systematically assessed. In this work, the experimental accuracy of commercial databases is assessed by comparing thermodynamic predictions with experimental results, which allows further refinement of the CALPHAD databases.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Materials and Methods</head><p>The RHEAs produced and studied here were selected using an alloy discover tool developed at the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) in Dayton, OH, USA. This tool runs batch CALPHAD calculations through available thermodynamic data and allows the user to screen alloys based on a set of physical and thermodynamic criteria. In this work equiatomic, four component systems were screened using the 2013 Al, Co, Fe, Mo, Nb, Ni, Sol, and Ti PANDAT databases. Alloys were also selected based upon the following criteria: BCC as the major phase, a maximum density of 13 g/cm 3 , material cost below $500/kg, the absence of volatile elements and minimal or no sigma (σ) phase predicted by CALPHAD. The alloying elements were restricted to Ti, Hf, Nb, Ta, Cr, Mo, W and Al.</p><p>Additional thermodynamic simulations using Thermo-Calc ® and the TCHEA1 and TCHEA2 databases were performed for all possible quaternary combinations. The quaternary equiatomic mixtures predicted to be single-phase BCC at any temperature were chosen. A total of twelve alloys, with the compositions given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>, were produced by arc melting under an inert argon atmosphere by ATI Specialty Alloys &amp; Components using commercially-pure elements. Care was taken during the melting process to limit the extent of elemental vaporization by adding the elements with lower vapor pressures in late stages. After all elements were added, each alloy button was re-melted at least three times to ensure homogeneity, which was confirmed by Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy (EDS). Following melting, the alloys were homogenized at 1400 °C under high vacuum across five individual treatments for a total of 35 hours.</p><p>The as-cast and the heat-treated alloys were characterized by a combination of techniques. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) was performed using an FEI Quanta 600i Environmental SEM equipped with EDS. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) was performed using an FEI Talos F200X equipped with a Super-X EDS detector. TEM foils were prepared using an FEI Helios 600 Focused Ion Beam (FIB) system. A final thinning step using 2kV accelerating voltage was used to minimize the beam damage to the sample. X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) was performed using a Philips X'Pert PRO MPD with a Cu K  radiation source and an X'Celerator detector in Bragg-Brentano reflection geometry. Specimens for XRD were hotmounted in bakelite, ground and polished with 1m diamond media. Scans were conducted such that only the sample was illuminated by the X-Ray beam. Selected samples were also characterized by synchrotron XRD at sector 11 at Argonne National Laboratory's Advanced Photon Source with a wavelength of 0.457651 Å. The synchrotron XRD samples were prepared by cooling ingot pieces with liquid nitrogen and crushing them into small pieces in an Al 2 O 3 mortar and pestle. To ensure the absorption factor of all the samples would be negligible, they were diluted in SiO 2 glass in ratios of 1 part of alloy powder for 3 or 4 parts of SiO 2 glass. This generated an amorphous halo in the background.</p><p>Selected synchrotron XRD patterns were quantified by Rietveld refinement using GSAS-II software. The starting structure of the C15 Laves was based on the Cu 2 Mg structure. It was assumed that the Cr would adopt the Cu sublattice and other elements would occupy the Mg sublattice. This was based upon the CrNbTaTi alloy composition measured by EDS, as shown later.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T</head><p>Vickers microhardness tests were performed on all of the single-phase RHEAs. A load of 0.5 kg was used and a total of 10 indents in random positions on the buttons were made to provide reasonable statistics.</p><p>The experimentally observed phases were compared to CALPHAD thermodynamic simulations performed with ThermoCalc®. For the CALPHAD predictions, although the TCHEA 1 database was initially used in the alloy selection step, the new TCHEA 2 database was for phase analysis and provided better overall agreement with the experimental results. The phase equilibria of the alloys produced here were also compared to several empirical parameters, namely, the electronegativity difference ( and Valence Electron Concentration (VEC) parameters as described below.</p><p>The  parameter estimates the atomic size mismatch between the elements in solution using the following equation 1.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">𝛿 = √ ∑ 𝑖=1 𝑛 𝑥 𝑖 (1 - 𝑥 𝑖 ∑ 𝑗 𝑛 𝑥 𝑗 𝑟 𝑗 ) 2<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where n, x i and r i are the total number of elements in the alloy and the mole fraction and atomic radii of the ith element, respectively. If the calculated  parameter is too high, the alloy is unlikely to be single-phase <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>. This is based on the Hume-Rothery principle that for a solid solution to exist, the size of the solute and solvent atoms must be similar. The atomic radii used in this work were proposed by Guo <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>. The  parameter accounts for the liquid enthalpy (ΔH mix ) and ideal entropy of mixing (ΔS mix ), as well as the melting point (T m ) of the alloy, as shown in equation 2.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">Ω = 𝑇 𝑚 Δ𝑆 𝑚𝑖𝑥 Δ𝐻 𝑚𝑖𝑥 (2)</formula><p>The melting point is calculated by the composition weighted average of the melting points of all of the pure elements (T i ), as given in equation 3.</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">𝑇 𝑚 = ∑ 𝑖=1 𝑛 𝑇 𝑖 𝑐 𝑖 (3)</formula><p>The enthalpy of mixing is calculated by equation 4.</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">Δ𝐻 𝑚𝑖𝑥 = ∑ 𝑖=1,𝑗≠𝑖 𝑛 4ΔH 𝑖𝑗 𝑚𝑖𝑥 𝑐 𝑖 𝑐 𝑗 (<label>4</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_4">)</formula><p>where ΔH 𝑖𝑗 𝑚𝑖𝑥 is the enthalpy of mixing between the ith and jth elements at the equimolar concentration in the liquid phase calculated by Miedema's model.

The  parameter normalizes this by the configurational entropy and an average melting temperature.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>The XRD patterns from each alloy are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>, and the phases present are marked. Phase identification was performed by indexing the XRD patterns, in combination with SEM and TEM observations, as shown later. For the three Hf-containing alloys, only the as-cast XRD scan is shown. After the heat-treatment, the grains coarsened considerably, reaching a few millimeters in diameter, making them too large to generate sufficient counting statistics for XRD analysis.</p><p>The twelve alloys were divided into 3 families: (1) NbTaTi-containing alloys (marked with number 1 in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>), (2) Cr-containing alloys (number 2) and (3) Al-containing alloys (number 3). Each family had one alloy in common with the other two families, as indicated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>NbTaTi-Containing Alloys (Family 1)</head><p>The NbTaTi-containing alloys were all single-phase BCC in the as-cast condition. This can be seen in the XRD patterns displayed in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>. The microstructures in the as-cast condition were also similar. The top and bottoms of the arc-melted buttons displayed distinct microstructural regions, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">2a</ref>. While the two regions are both BCC, they differ in their degree of homogeneity; the top regions show equiaxed grains composed of cored dendritic structures, whereas the bottom regions are homogeneous in composition and exhibit an equiaxed microstructure (Fig. <ref type="figure">2b</ref>). The reason for this microstructural difference is due to the nature of the arc-melting. When the top of the button is being melted, the bottom surface in contact with the copper hearth is not melted, which results in a large thermal gradient across the sample. Since the bottom of the button is below the melting point of the alloy, it remains solid, but undergoes some homogenization as the top is melted.</p><p>The microstructures of the bottom of the buttons were not fully homogenized for all of the alloys. As shown in Figs. <ref type="figure">2b</ref> and<ref type="figure">2c</ref>, the AlNbTaTi alloy had a homogeneous microstructure in the bottom of the button, whereas the CrNbTaTi ingot displayed significant compositional gradients. The fact that different compositions display different microstructures at the bottom of the ingots is most likely a consequence of the processing parameters that are typically not</p></div>

Out of the five alloys, which were all single-phase after solidification, only HfNbTaTi, MoNbTaTi and WNbTaTi remained single-phase after heat treatment, as shown in Figs. <ref type="figure">3a-c</ref>. In addition, only the HfNbTaTi alloy was completely homogenized. The micrograph from this alloy (Fig. <ref type="figure">3a</ref>) was taken with a low voltage to allow the grain size to be seen by electron channeling contrast. The other two alloys that remained single-phase after heat-treatment, MoNbTaTi and WNbTaTi, still displayed small composition gradients. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> shows the approximate compositions measured by EDS of the brighter and darker regions in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>.</p><p>After heat-treating, the AlNbTaTi and CrNbTaTi alloys contained significant amounts of secondary phases. As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>, the secondary phase (dark phase) that formed in the CrNbTaTi alloy was significantly enriched in Cr and identified as the C15 Laves phase by synchrotron XRD (shown in later in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>). There are reports of Laves phase formation in RHEAs, especially in alloys containing Cr and V <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48]</ref>. Cr-containing Laves phases typically have the C14 or C15 structures when mixed with refractory metals. The composition measured for this phase (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>) indicates that Cr is most likely not sharing its sublattice with the other elements, and the phase is forming with a sublattice setting of Cr 2 (Nb,Ta,Ti).</p><p>In the AlNbTaTi alloy, the major volume fraction of microstructure was transformed into the A15 phase (light phase), which has a composition close to the initial composition of the alloy. The A15 phase is stable in the Al-Mo and Al-Nb systems, and forms with a composition Al 3 X (X being Nb or Mo). The EDS measurements shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> confirm that Al is most likely not sharing its sublattice. The other sublattice contains mainly Nb and Mo with some Ti. This phase formed and coarsened, quickly dominating the microstructure of the heat-treated sample. This phase is brittle and cracked, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">3f</ref>.</p><p>Vickers microhardness tests were performed on all the single-phase alloys in both the as-cast and heat-treated conditions (Table <ref type="table">3</ref>). As can be seen, the microhardness of the singlephase alloys did not change considerably before and after heat-treatment, which is not surprising since the heat-treatment is mostly a homogenizing treatment. Also, since the indents (around 60 m) are of the same order of magnitude as the microsegregation regions, the indents on the as-cast samples average over the composition profile, while in the heat-treated condition, the average compositions are being tested.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cr-Containing Alloys (Family 2)</head><p>The Cr-containing alloys were also single-phase BCC in the as-cast condition, with the exception of AlCrNbMo. In general, these alloys displayed significant composition gradients in the arc-melted buttons. The AlCrNbMo alloy displayed several peaks in the XRD pattern (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>). However, the SEM image of the as-cast sample consisted of single-phase dendrites with a eutectic-like interdentritic microconstituent, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4a</ref>. A FIB foil was prepared from the SEM sample in the region indicated by the yellow dashed line. A Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy -Dark Field (STEM-DF) image of the FIB sample is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4b</ref>. The interface between the dendritic and the interdendritic regions was mapped by EDS (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4c</ref>). The dendritic region, which is apparently single-phase in the SEM image, is actually composed of a fine mixture of two phases, one rich in Nb and Cr and the other rich in Mo. These phases are also present in the interdendritic regions. The two phases were identified as the A15 phase</p></div>

The morphology observed in the SEM suggests that the alloy likely solidified in a dendritic fashion. The solidification ended when a eutectic mixture between the A15 and C14 phases formed. The dendritic phase was most likely single-phase immediately after solidification, and probably decomposed into the C14 and A15 phases in the solid-state during cooling, via eutectoid reaction.</p><p>The CrNbTaTi (Fig. <ref type="figure">3d</ref>) and CrMoTaTi (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5a</ref>) alloys displayed two-phase microstructures after heat-treatment. Again, the secondary phase that precipitated is C15 Laves, as confirmed by the synchrotron XRD patterns in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>. The matrix of this alloy was not fully homogeneous after heat-treatment. In contrast, the CrMoNbTi alloy had a homogeneous composition profile, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5b</ref>. No secondary phases could be seen in the BCC matrix, as confirmed by the synchrotron XRD (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>). The CrNbTiW alloy displayed a large composition gradient in the SEM image and some fine dark particles. It is possible to see two bcc peaks in the heat-treated condition XRD pattern (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>). This indicates that this alloy may have 2 bcc phases.</p><p>The synchrotron XRD patterns of four Cr-containing alloys in the heat-treated condition are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>, which enabled the identification of the Laves phase. As can be seen in the CrMoTaTi and CrNbTaTi alloys in comparison to the AlCrNbMo alloy, the C14 and C15 Laves phases have their most intense peaks in similar positions; however, there are several different lower intensity peaks that are different, as shown in the magnified view on the right of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>. Rietveld refinement was performed on the three patterns containing the BCC and C15 Laves phases to quantify their volume fractions. The CrMoNbTa sample contained none of the C15 phase, while the CrMoTaTi and CrNbTaTi have 6.7 and 24.7 vol. % C15, respectively. All the reflections from the AlCrMoNb sample were indexed as a mixture of C14 Laves phase and the A15 phase, as seen in TEM of the as-cast sample (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>).</p><p>The microhardness of the single-phase samples is also presented in Table <ref type="table">3</ref>. The microhardness of the CrMoTaTi alloy was also measured, although this alloy was not singlephase in the heat-treated condition. The volume fraction of the secondary phase was small (around 6%) and the precipitates (C15 Laves) were relatively coarse, which should not contribute significantly to strengthening, as further discussed in the next section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Al-Containing Alloys (Family 3)</head><p>The AlMoNbTi alloy was similar to the AlNbTaTi alloy described previously. It was singlephase BCC in the as-cast condition, as shown in the XRD pattern (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>) and in the SEM image (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7a</ref>). After the heat-treatment, this alloy contained coarse A15 phase precipitates (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7b</ref>).</p><p>The two Al-Hf alloys were different from the other alloys studied in this work. These two alloys were relatively unremarkable in the as-cast condition, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8a</ref>. After heattreatment, an unremarkable single-phase microstructure with coarse grains was observed, as also shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8a</ref>. The XRD patterns from these two alloys displayed extra reflections from those expected from a BCC alloy (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>). These two alloys were analyzed by TEM, and both of them were characterized as single-phase B2. The SADPs from AlHfTaTi are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8b</ref>, and similar patterns were acquired for AlHfNbTi. This explains the extra reflections in the XRD patterns, which can be fully described as a single-phase B2 alloy.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Phase Prediction Models</head><p>The phases identified experimentally were compared to thermodynamic predictions. CALPHAD was performed with Thermo-Calc® using the TCHEA2 database. Predictions of the phases formed under equilibrium at temperatures from above the liquidus temperature down to 500 °C were predicted and are plotted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9</ref>. The CALPHAD results are discussed in the next section.</p><p>The CALPHAD simulations also provide valuable insights into the melting points of the alloys. The estimated liquidus, solidus and solidification interval of each alloy is presented in Table <ref type="table">3</ref>. As expected, alloys containing Mo and W have higher liquidus temperatures. The solidus temperatures, however, are dependent on the interplay between the liquid and solid free energy curves that vary with temperature and composition. The solidification interval is an important property in alloy production; alloys with large solidification intervals tend to produce considerable segregation and casting defects, and are therefore difficult to process.</p><p>Besides the CALPHAD predictions, the empirical criteria described in the methods section were applied to the alloys produced in this work. The calculated values are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">4</ref>. The results provided by empirical parameters are discussed in the next section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Overall, the CALPHAD predictions using the TCHEA2 database are in agreement with the experimental results. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9</ref>, the HfNbTaTi, MoNbTaTi, WNbTaTi and CrMoNbTi alloys were predicted to have a large BCC single-phase field, which was consistent with the ascast and 1400°C heat-treated experimental observations. The CrMoTaTi, CrNbTiW and AlMoNbTi were also predicted to have a relatively large BCC single-phase field and, while they were observed to be single-phase in the as-cast condition, a minor volume fraction of precipitates was observed in all three alloys in the heattreated condition. Among these alloys, only the CrMoTaTi alloy is predicted to have secondary phases precipitated at 1400 °C. Furthermore, the simulations correctly predict which phase forms in these alloys, i.e., the C15 Laves phase in the CrMoTaTi alloy, the C14 Laves phase in the CrNbTiW alloy and the A15 phase in AlMoNbTi alloy.</p><p>The CrNbTaTi, AlNbTaTi and AlCrNbMo alloys were not predicted to have a single-phase BCC field at any temperature using the TCHEA2 database, whereas the predicted single-phase BCC field using the TCHEA1 database was larger (calculations provided in the Supplementary Materials). All 3 of these alloys contained a large volume fraction of secondary phase in the heat-treated condition, illustrating how database-dependent CALPHAD predictions are. Both the AlNbTaTi and CrNbTaTi alloys were mostly single-phase BCC in the as-cast condition (CrNbTaTi had a small volume fraction of the C15 Laves phase). The lack of a significant fraction of second phases in the experimental alloys indicate the sluggish formation kinetics of the intermetallic Topologically Closed Packed (TCP) phases, such as the A15 and Laves phases, compared to the non-faceted BCC phase during solidification after arc-melting. Upon heattreatment, the CALPHAD simulations can accurately predict the phases present in the CrNbTaTi and AlCrNbMo alloys.</p><p>The CALPHAD predictions of the two Al-Hf-containing samples, namely AlHfNbTi and AlHfTaTi, were also incorrect. As shown by the combination of XRD and TEM in the previous</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A C C E P T E D M</head><p>A N U S C R I P T section, both these alloys were single-phase B2 in the as-cast and heat-treated conditions, whereas the CALPHAD simulations predicted the formation of several different intermetallic phases. Other RHEA compositions with B2 phases have been reported <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref>; however, to our knowledge, these B2 phase fields with high Al and Hf contents are being reported here for the first time. The B2 phase in RHEAs tends to be continuous and not form as precipitates in a continuous BCC matrix, which is desirable to increase strength with minor losses in ductility. This new B2 composition field leads to the possibility of creating BCC high temperature alloys by finding a neighboring B2 + BCC phase-field, given that both HfNbTi and HfTaTi are expected to be single-phase BCC by CALPHAD simulations.</p><p>Although CALPHAD predictions tend to be reasonably accurate for predicting the phases that form in multi-component alloys, the exact compositions and volume fractions tend to be less accurate. For example, by simulating the phase equilibria of the CrNbTaTi phase, the calculated BCC phase composition (Cr 15.9 Nb 27.5 Ta 27.4 Ti 29.1 ) is leaner in Cr compared to the experimentally measured values (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>), and by consequence the C15 calculated composition is richer in Cr than the experimentally measured value. Also, the predicted volume fractions are not exact; the volume fraction of C15 phase in CrNbTaTi is calculated to be 16.5%, while the experimentally measured value is higher (24.7%). Inaccurate composition and volume fraction predictions are most likely a result of the absence of higher order interaction parameters for several of these phases (since usually only binaries and some ternaries are described in these databases).</p><p>Overall, the predictions by the TCHEA2 database are more accurate than those using the TCHEA1; this is shown by the comparison between the predictions provided in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9</ref> and the TCHEA 1 predictions provided as supplementary material. More specifically, the TCHEA1 database had an overall poor description of the Laves phases, which are shown here to be important for the Cr-containing alloys. This description is improved in the TCHEA2 database, yielding more accurate predictions. However, room for improvement exists for the simulations containing Al. The simulations predicted the wrong precipitate phase in the AlNbTaTi, AlMoNbTi and AlCrNbMo alloys ( instead of A15), and also did not predict the single-phase B2 field in the AlHfNbTi and AlHfTaTi alloys. While both databases have all the binaries between the elements used in this work assessed, the TCHEA2 database has 135 ternary phase diagrams fully accessed and 308 partially assessed, while TCHEA1 has respectively 104 and 96.</p><p>The predictions by the empirical criteria can be better visualized if plotted on a  versus  plot. In the literature, there are threshold values used to predict whether an alloy will be single-phase. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">10</ref> shows an  versus  plot together with several RHEAs from the literature. The full list of alloys plotted are provided as supplementary material. Here, only alloys that were heat-treated at 1200 °C or above are included, given that consideration of as-cast samples can be misleading, since these microstructures are usually not in their equilibrium condition.</p><p>In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">10</ref>, the region within the blue lines is predicted to be single-phase using the threshold values from the literature. However, as can be seen, the actual region in which all of the single phase RHEAs are contained (orange box) is smaller than the blue region, especially with respect to the  parameter. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">10</ref> shows that the accuracy of these empirical parameters is not high. We can see trends that hold for extreme values of these parameters: the region with small  and high  only contains single-phase alloys, while alloys with high  are all multi-</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T</head><p>phase. There exists a large transition region between both regimes, in which these parameters do not successfully predict if the alloy can be single-phase or not.</p><p>Here we propose an explanation for the inaccuracy of these empirical parameters. When calculating a single parameter of an alloy by averaging binary interactions of the constituents, a significant amount of information is lost in the averaging procedure. This might not have a significant impact if all the values being averaged are somewhat similar. However, if we have very different binary interaction, information might be lost in translation. For example, if we have an A 33.3 B 33.3 C 33.3 alloy, with a very negative H mix between the A and B elements, a very positive H mix between A and C and a negligible H mix between B and C, the calculated  parameter will be very large, since the total H mix is close to zero and we are averaging these values. Under this condition, the  parameter will indicate a strong preference for single-phase formation. In reality, a simple single-phase solid solution will be unlikely, since A and B will lower the energy by being nearest neighbors, while A and C will lower the energy by not being nearest neighbors. A similar argument can be drawn for the  parameter.</p><p>These parameters might be useful for comparing similar alloys, as will be shown later, or as a quick assessment of the likelihood of forming a simple single-phase solid solution, but not necessarily as definitive parameters. This is also true for other types of HEAs <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Since the CALPHAD predictions are becoming more accurate with the development of new databases and present the possibility of estimating the phase equilibria at any temperature, this type of empirical prediction will probably only still be used in systems where CALPHAD databases are unavailable.</p><p>The region in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">10</ref> that contains all single-phase RHEAs (orange box) is smaller than the region valid across all HEA classes (blue box); however, these regions would probably be bigger if more alloys were accessed. Due to the inaccuracies discussed before, setting a fixed threshold value for these parameters could be misleading, since we again would be using a simple parameter to compare significantly different alloys. The threshold concept might be applicable in alloy subsystems with similar components as discussed next. No correlation was observed in this work between the number of phases formed and the  parameter. The VEC values are all well within the range expected for BCC alloys <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52]</ref>.</p><p>As an example of how we propose the  parameters should be used, the content of the C15 Laves phase present in these alloys as a function of the calculated  parameter was examined. The single-phase CrMoNbTi alloy and the two alloys containing C15 Laves phases, CrMoTaTi and CrNbTaTi, are plotted as a function of their  values in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">11a</ref>. The comparison between these alloys is meaningful, since the elements being interchanged between these alloys (Nb, Mo and Ta) are somewhat similar with respect to melting point, crystal structure and atomic size.</p><p>As seen in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">11a</ref>, the increase in the calculated  value correlates directly with the content of the Laves phase that formed in these Cr-containing alloys. The Laves phases are TCP phases that typically form, due to large size mismatch between the elements <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>; bigger  values trigger the precipitation of intermetallics, such as the C15 Laves phase. The CrNbTiW alloy was not included in this analysis, since it was not a single-phase BCC with Laves. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">11b</ref>, the calculated Laves phase fraction at 1400 o C by CALPHAD is plotted against the calculated  parameter for several Cr x (NbTaTi) 1-x alloys. This plot further confirms the correlation between</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T</head><p>the  parameter and the amount of Laves phase formed in these alloys. As shown in the figure, when the composition is leaner in Cr (the left of the plot), the calculated  is small and the alloy is single-phase BCC. As  increases, the alloy continues to be single-phase up to around 15 at% Cr, or . Above that value, the C15 Laves phase starts to form. The  onset here is smaller than found in the other experimental alloys, perhaps due to the inaccuracies in the CALPHAD predictions with respect to volume fraction, which is interpreted here in a qualitative fashion.</p><p>Although the A15 phase observed in the Al-containing samples is also classified as a TCP phase, it typically forms due to valence electron concentration effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>. Furthermore, the A15 phase typically forms in low negative heat of mixing alloys <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>. Indeed, Al has highly negative enthalpies of mixing with most of these refractory elements (especially with Ti and Hf), as shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">4</ref>. Therefore, the A15 phase typically forms at low  values, rather than at large  values. The AlCrNbMo alloy, which has both Laves and A15, has a relatively small  and a relatively large  value.</p><p>The results shown here suggest that RHEA alloying strategies to form single-phase alloys do not necessarily coincide with the highest entropy equiatomic compositions. For example, in order to avoid the Laves phases, we need to decrease the atomic size mismatch, which could be achieved by decreasing the Cr content. To reduce the A15 phase content, the enthalpy of mixing of the alloy needs to be increased (to get closer to zero), by decreasing the content of Al or by decreasing other elements that have a very negative enthalpy of mixing with Al. This assumption can be qualitatively tested by CALPHAD predictions. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">12a</ref>, a pseudo-binary for Cr x (NbTaTi) 1-x is plotted for x between 0 and 1. Starting at the CrNbTaTi alloy marked by the dotted line, by increasing the Cr content, the composition gets closer to the Laves phase field, so the content of this phase increases, while decreasing the content of Cr will increase the BCC phase content. Although all the discussion here was based on the  parameter effects on the Cr-containing alloys, we could draw similar arguments for the relation between the  parameter and the A15 phase in the Al-containing alloys. Other elemental additions that make an alloy go from a single-phase field to a multi-phase field could potentially be modeled in a similar way, considering that the specific reason for the precipitation can be attributed to a single parameter, such as atomic size mismatch or enthalpy of mixing.</p><p>The hardness values of all the single-phase alloys produced in this work were analyzed in comparison to the  parameter. Additionally, the elastic modulus mismatch parameter (G) was calculated, as suggested by Toda-Caraballo <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>. The G term uses the shear moduli of the pure metals to estimate the overall elastic modulus mismatch caused by a solute in a solid solution with an average stiffness given by the rule of mixtures. This comparison is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">13</ref>.</p><p>From Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">13</ref>, it is clear that that no strong correlation exists between the microhardness of these alloys and other parameters. It is most surprising to see little correlation between the microhardness and the andG parameters, since the strength of HEAs has, on several occasions <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref> been attributed only to the large lattice distortion and/or elastic modulus mismatch caused by mixing atoms with different atomic sizes and stiffnesses. In previous studies, a combination of these two parameters was used to represent the yield strength and hardness of RHEAs <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38]</ref>. This method combines the average strength of all elements with their elastic moduli and atomic size mismatch. This model is not described in detail here, but</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T</formula><p>was applied in the same way as Yao et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. The calculated hardnesses are presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">13c</ref>, where it is clear that some trend between the calculated and experimental hardness values is observed, but the overall quantitative accuracy could be improved. This is likely due to one or more of the following factors. First, this model uses constants for the elements in solution based on their pure form. However, since Ti, Hf and Al are not BCC in their pure states, their atomic radii and shear moduli are expected to be different when dissolved in a BCC phase. Second, the model averages the yield strengths of the pure metals to create a baseline strength value for the material; this averaging approach has no clear physical meaning. Third, there is an important barrier for the dislocation motion that is not being considered directly, namely, the fact that the cores of screw dislocations in these materials <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref> are non-planar and create a large lattice resistance; this creates an important thermally-activated barrier to dislocation glide that is not being considered. The model used is a good first approximation of the strength of these materials, however, changes incorporating the discussed factors would most likely increase the accuracy of the model. It should be noted that the atomic size () elastic modulus mismatch (G) from Figs. 13 a and b are not calculated by the exact same way as using the literature model <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38]</ref> in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">13 c</ref>, the experimental data does not correlate strongly with both.</p><p>A similar effect was observed in NbVTiZr(Al) x alloys (with x ranging from 0 to 1.8) <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref>. The atomic size mismatch decreases with increasing Al content, while the hardness increases.</p><p>Here we show in a large number of alloys with different elements that the lattice distortion and elastic modulus mismatch are not directly proportional to the hardness (or strength) of RHEAs. This result is particularly surprising, since the lattice distortion has been shown to dictate the strength in FCC HEAs <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">57]</ref>; therefore, this effect is most likely tied to the unique nature of the BCC metals.</p><p>Conclusions A total of twelve RHEAs were produced, heat-treated and characterized using a combination of analytical techniques. The results were interpreted based on different phase equilibria models and the following conclusions are made:</p><p>-Four new single-phase BCC alloys, in which the BCC phase is stable at 1400°C, were discovered, namely the equiatomic HfNbTaTi, MoNbTaTi, WNbTaTi and CrMoNbTi alloys; -Overall, the CALPHAD predictions using the TCHEA2 database were accurate with respect to the phases formed. The phase predictions for some Al-containing (AlNbTaTi, AlHfNbTi and AlHfTaTi) alloys, as well as composition of secondary phases and their volume fractions, were somewhat inaccurate; -The Al-containing alloys without Hf all precipitated secondary phases upon heattreatment, mostly the A15 phase; this is a consequence of the large negative enthalpies of mixing of Al with the other elements in these alloys; -Cr-containing alloys are prone to forming Laves phases, due to the large atomic size mismatch caused by adding the smaller Cr atoms into these RHEAs; -The empirical phase prediction parameters evaluated in this work are fairly inaccurate as predictors for the formation of simple, single-phase solid solutions. This is most likely a consequence of the loss of information that occurs while averaging several binary interactions;</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T</head><p>-By applying these parameters in groups of similar alloys, correlations can be found.

The two-phase region with lower lattice distortion, where the CrNbTaTi alloy is located, show a linear increase of the C15 volume fraction with the  parameter. The actual phase content calculated by CALPHAD is most likely inaccurate, however, the trend is most likely correct, since the alloy composition is moving closer to the C15 phase composition.

Alloys produced in this work, as well as several others from the literature, are shown. The blue lines correspond to the threshold values for the two parameters valid for all HEAs. In orange, the values valid specifically for RHEAs found in this work are indicated. Fig. 11 (a) Plot of the experimentally measured content of C15 Laves phase as a function of the total atomic size mismatch () in three of the Cr-containing alloys characterized by synchrotron XRD and quantified by Rietveld refinement. As shown, as  increases the amount of Laves phase also increases. (b) Qualitative comparison between the empirical  parameter and the C15 Laves phase content calculated by CALPHAD plot showing the increasing volume fraction of C15 as  increases. Each point corresponds to a 5 at% increase of the Cr content from NbTaTi to up to Cr 50 (NbTaTi)</figDesc></figure>
