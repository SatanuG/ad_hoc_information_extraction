<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>A low-density high entropy alloy Al 10 Nb 15 Ta 5 Ti 30 Zr 40 has been developed which exhibits excellent compressive room temperature ductility, despite the presence of Al. Microstructure, room temperature and elevated temperature mechanical properties of this newly-designed alloy have been reported in as cast and heat-treated conditions. The homogenized and continuously cooled (water quenching or air cooling) conditions of this alloy consist of a nanoscale mixture of a disordered BCC and an ordered B2 phases, while subsequent low temperature annealing treatment leads to the formation of additional phases. In the homogenized condition, the yield stress of the alloy is 1050 MPa at 23 °C, 852 MPa at 400 °C and 1059 MPa at 600 °C. Above 600 °C, the yield stress decreases rapidly with increasing temperature becoming 250 MPa at 800 °C and less than 50 MPa at 1000 °C and 1200 °C.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Refractory complex concentrated alloys (RCCAs) have recently attracted much attention as candidate materials beyond Ni-based superalloys <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> . RCCAs are a special group of refractory alloys, which consist of 3 or more principal refractory elements and may also contain other elements for improving particular properties. While conventional refractory alloys have poor oxidation resistance and high density, which limit their use in elevated temperature flight applications, several reported RCCAs have much improved oxidation resistance and reduced density <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> . Some RCCAs show impressive specific stress at temperatures 1000-1600 °C, i.e. significantly beyond Ni-based superalloys. Most of the reported RCCAs are single-phase BCC structures; however, those containing low-density elements, such as Al, Ti, Zr, V and/or Cr may also contain secondary, often intermetallic phases among which ordered B2 and Laves are most commonly reported. Having brittle intermetallic phases, the reduced-density RCCAs generally show poor room temperature ductility. Few attempts have been made to develop low-density RCCAs with good combination of specific strength and ductility; however until recently only single-phase BCC RCCAs or RCCAs that experience transformation-induced plasticity have been reported to be ductile at room temperature <ref type="bibr">[2 , 4-8]</ref> .</p><p>One of the noticeable achievements in the RCCA development is a discovery of refractory superalloys (RSAs) consisting of two coherent BCC and B2 phases <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> . The microstructure of RSAs looks morphologically similar to that of Ni-base superalloys <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> . The disordered BCC phase is usually present as nanometer-sized cuboidal precipitates, whereas the ordered B2 phase forms a continuous network (matrix). While many of these two-phase RSAs show attractive elevated temperature strength and ductility, in the annealed condition they all have limited ductility at room temperature (RT). It is thought that poor RT ductility is caused by the continuous matrix being an ordered B2 intermetallic phase. This suggestion has recently been proven by Soni et al. <ref type="bibr">[13 , 14]</ref> who developed a special heat treatment process for an Al 0.5 NbTa 0.8 Ti 1.5 V 0.2 Zr RSA to destroy the continuous network of the B2 phase and make the BCC phase continuous and B2 discontinuous. This heat treatment made the alloy very ductile at room temperature <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> . In the other recent work Soni et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> developed an Al 10 Nb 15 Ta 5 Ti 30 Zr 40 RSA. The composition of this alloy corresponds to the composition of the B2 phase identified in the Table <ref type="table">1</ref> Nominal and actual composition (in. at.%) of the produced alloy after casting (Cast) and after annealing at 1100 °C for 24 h (WQ) measured using SEM/EDS or EPMA methods. two-phase B2 + BCC AlMo 0.5 NbTa 0.5 TiZr 0.5 and Al 0.25 NbTaTiZr RSAs after isothermal annealing at 1000 °C for 24 h. Instead of having singlephase B2 structure, the new alloy has been found to be a two-phase structure, consisting of a very fine, nanometer-sized dispersion of BCC and B2 coherent domains. Soni et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> conducted a detailed analysis of the microstructure and phase composition of this alloy after different heat treatment conditions and found that this nanometer-sized dispersed structure always formed after annealing above ~800 °C, independently on the cooling rate. Long time annealing at lower temperatures resulted in coarsening of B2 particles and formation of an additional, AlZr 2 phase. In the present work, which is continuation of previous work by Soni et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> , mechanical properties of the Al 10 Nb 15 Ta 5 Ti 30 Zr 40 RSA in different heat treatment conditions are reported in the temperature range from 25 °C to 1200 °C. The microstructure and phases present in the alloy after deformation are also reported. Correlations between the microstructure and mechanical properties, as well as strengthening mechanisms operating at different temperatures, are discussed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Experimental procedures</head><p>The alloy was prepared by vacuum induction melting of high purity elements followed by suction casting in rods of ~13 mm in diameter and 55 mm in length. The chemical composition of the alloy measured using SEM/EDS and EPMA is given in Table <ref type="table">1</ref> . The microhardness and compression properties of the alloy were studied in the as cast (Cast) condition, annealed at 1100 °C for 24 h and slow cooled (SC) condition and annealed at 1100 °C for 24 h and water quenched (WQ) condition. The properties of the WQ alloy sample after additional annealing at 600 °C during 72 h and air cooling (low-temperature annealing, LTA) were also studied. During annealing at 1100 °C and 600 °C and air cooling the sample was in a quartz tube under Ar (1100 °C) or He (600 °C) atmosphere. Details on heat treatment are given elsewhere <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> . The alloy density was measured using Archimedes' principle for samples in Cast and WQ conditions. Density values of 6.51 ± 0.02 g/cm 3 (Cast) and 6.45 ± 0.01 g/cm 3 (WQ) were obtained. Specimens for compression testing had dimensions of 4.6 mm × 4.6 mm × 7.4 mm, with their faces being ground to ensure parallelism between the opposite faces and orthogonality between the nearest faces. The compression direction was parallel to the axis of the cast rod. Compression tests were conducted using an MTS screw driven machine equipped with a Brew vacuum furnace. The load capacity of the machine is 44.5 kN. The vacuum during high temperature tests was 2 × 10 -3 Pa or higher. The compression testing procedure consisted of placing a specimen between the dies, vacuuming to 2 × 10 -3 Pa or higher, heating to a temperature at the heating rate of 50 °C/min, holding at the temperature for 15 min, loading at a ram speed of 0.0074 mm/s (this corresponds to the initial strain rate of 0.001 s -1 ) until 50% upset is reached, turning off heat and cooling in the furnace. Room temperature tests were conducted in air. The sample Young's modulus during compression testing was measured using a method described in details elsewhere <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> .</p><p>X-ray diffraction patterns were taken from the flat, polished crosssections of the cast, annealed and compression tested specimens using a Bruker D2 Phaser diffractometer and Cu K 𝛼 radiation. Microstructure and chemical composition were studied using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), electron probe micro-analysis (EPMA), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atom probe tomography (APT) methods, which are described in detail in previous publication <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> .</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Microstructure in the as-cast and heat treated conditions</head><p>The microstructure of the alloy in the as-cast and heat treated conditions was described in detail by Soni et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> . Here we outline the previous findings for the purpose of correlating the microstructures to the observed mechanical properties and deformation behavior.</p><p>The as-cast alloy had a typical dendritic structure (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1 a</ref>). Dendrites were rich in Nb and Ta and their volume fraction was 68 ± 7%. The interdendritic regions were rich in Al and Zr. X-ray diffraction revealed the presence of two BCC phases with very similar lattice parameters: a BCC1 = 340.2 pm and a BCC2 = 341.9 pm. In the WQ condition the alloy had a coarse-grained BCC structure with the average grain size above 1 mm (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1 b</ref>). Detailed HAADF-STEM analysis, carried out in an aberration-corrected TITAN TEM, identified a coherent, co-continuous mixture of nanometer-sized domains of the disordered BCC and ordered B2 phases inside the grains (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1 c</ref>), which is likely an indication of frozen early stages of spinodal decomposition. The regions of darker contrast in this co-continuous mixture correspond to the ordered B2 structure, while the regions exhibiting a lighter contrast correspond to the disordered BCC structure. A few samples of the approximate boundaries between the BCC and B2 phases are marked by blue lines in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1 c</ref>. There were small differences in the concentrations of the alloying elements in these two phases, as B2 was slightly enriched with Al and Zr. X-ray diffraction identified two BCC phases in WQ samples, with a BCC1 = 339.3 pm and a BCC2 = 341.1 pm, and the volume fractions of 33% and 67%, respectively. The SEM microstructure of SC samples appeared similar to WQ samples. However, high-resolution TEM identified the presence of nanoparticles of the ordered omega phase in addition to BCC and B2 nano-clusters. X-ray diffraction revealed a single BCC phase ( a = 341.0 pm) and very minor traces of the omega phase and non-identified phase in the SC sample.</p><p>The LTA sample had a microstructure consisting of large grains of the BCC1 phase and ellipsoidal precipitates of two different phases (disordered BCC3 and hexagonal AlZr 2 ) formed during annealing at 600 °C (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1 d</ref>). The new phases had distinct Z contrast (BCC3 is bright and AlZr 2 is dark), their volume fractions were 20% and 17%, respectively, and the chemical composition of these phases is given in Table <ref type="table">2</ref> .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Deformation behavior</head><p>To identify the effect of different heat treatment conditions on deformation behavior of the alloy, the samples in the as-cast condition, annealed 24 h at 1100 °C and water quenched (WQ) condition, and annealed 24 h at 1100 °C and slow cooled (SC) condition were initially compression tested at 23, 600, and 800 °C. Additionally, a sample annealed at 600 °C (LTA) was compression tested at 23 °C. The true stress vs. true strain deformation curves from these tests are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> and the measured yield stress ( 𝜎 y ) values are given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> . At room temperature (RT), the deformation behavior of the alloy samples in the cast, SC and WQ conditions was almost identical: 𝜎 y was 1074 ± 25 MPa and the samples showed continuous strain hardening until the end of deformation (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2 a</ref>). Due to a more noticeable strain hardening at the beginning of deformation, the flow stress of the cast sample was about 60-100 MPa higher than the SC and WQ samples at true strains higher  than 0.15. The alloy in these three conditions was very ductile showing no evidence of cracking during RT deformation. The alloy sample, which was additionally annealed at 600 °C, was stronger than three other conditions, having 𝜎 y = 1173 MPa and more noticeable strain hardening. However, this sample approached the maximum true stress of 1418 MPa at the true strain 𝜀 = 0.14 and fractured at 𝜀 f = 0.27 (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2 a</ref>). The deformation behaviors of cast, WQ and SC samples at 600 °C (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2 b</ref>) were quite different from that at 23 °C (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2 a</ref>). Although the yield stress at these two temperatures was almost the same (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> ), the samples quickly approached the peak stress at the beginning of deformation at 600 °C and then their true stress decreased continuously until the end of deformation. (A slight increase in the flow stress at the end of deformation, at 𝜀 &gt; 0.4, was due to friction between the sample and die surfaces). Thorough analysis of the deformed samples did not identify any evidence of failure; thus, the stress decrease was due to the microstructural changes.</p><p>The yield stress of the samples dropped considerably at 800 °C see ( Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2 c</ref>, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> ). At this temperature, the cast alloy had 𝜎 y = 124 MPa, approached true peak stress 𝜎 p = 148 MPa at true strain 𝜀 p = 0.05, and then showed a very slight decrease in the flow stress with increasing strain. The WQ and SC samples had more than twice higher yield stress, 251 MPa and 270 MPa, respectively, than the cast sample. However, their flow stress quickly dropped after the yielding and approached the values comparable with the flow stress of the cast alloy (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2 c</ref>).</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2 d</ref> shows the true stress vs. true strain curves of WQ samples at few other temperatures. It can be noted that the deformation of the alloy in the temperature range of 250-500 °C occurred at almost the same stress values and the deformation behavior in this temperature range was also identical. At temperatures 600 °C and above, a rapid stress drop occurred at the beginning of deformation, which followed by a continuous decrease in the flow stress (at 600 °C) or a steady state flow at almost constant true stress (at 700 °C and higher).</p><p>The temperature dependence of the yield stress, 𝜎 y at 𝜀 = 0.002, and the true flow stress 𝜎 20 at true strain 𝜀 = 0.2 of the WQ alloy is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref> . Both 𝜎 y and 𝜎 20 decreased with increasing temperature in the temperature ranges of 23°C to 400 °C and 600 °C (for 𝜎 y ) or 500 °C (for 𝜎 20 ) to 1200 °C, more rapidly in the higher temperature range. However, an anomalous increase in 𝜎 y and 𝜎 20 was observed from 400 to 600 °C and from 400 to 500 °C, respectively. In the temperature range from 23 to 500 °C, 𝜎 20 was higher than 𝜎 y , indicating strain hardening; in the temperature range from 600 to 1000 °C 𝜎 20 was lower than 𝜎 y indicating strain softening; and at 1200 °C 𝜎 20 was the same as 𝜎 y indicating true steady-state flow.   </p><formula xml:id="formula_0">𝐸 = 116 ( 1 -8 . 0 10 -4 𝑇 ) (1a) 𝐺 = 44 ( 1 -8 . 0 10 -4 𝑇 ) (<label>1b</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_1">)</formula><p>where E and G are given in GPa and T is given in °C.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Microstructure of Al 10 Nb 15 Ta 5 Ti 30 Zr 40 after compression deformation</head><p>The deformed WQ samples were used for the microstructural analysis after compression deformation with 50% height reduction. X-ray diffraction patterns of the specimens deformed at 23, 400, and 800 °C revealed essentially single-phase BCC structure (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">5</ref> ). After deformation at RT, the diffraction peaks became wider than in the 1100 °C annealed and water quenched specimen and all the diffraction peaks belonged to a sole BCC phase (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">5 a</ref>). No peak shoulders were observed contrary to the annealed sample. A small diffraction peak from a minor, unidentified phase located near 2 Θ = 31.4°or <ref type="bibr">34.1°w</ref> as present on the diffraction patterns of 400 °C or 800 °C deformed specimens (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">5 b,</ref><ref type="figure">d</ref>). At the same time, three major phases: disordered BCC, ordered cubic B2 and ordered hexagonal AlZr 2 ,--were clearly identified in the specimen deformed at 600 °C (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">5 c</ref>). Additionally, a diffraction peak from a minor, unidentified phase located near 2 Θ = 31.2°was also present. The lattice parameters of the BCC and B2 phases are given in the respective figures. The lattice parameters of the hexagonal phase are a = 485.6 pm and c = 589.7 pm.</p><p>SEM and EBSD analysis confirmed a single-phase, coarse-grained structure in the specimens deformed at 23 and 400 °C.  (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6 d</ref>). The evidence of B2 superlattice reflections in the [100] zone axis of the BCC matrix indicates that ordered regions were still present in the microstructure after deformation at 400 °C (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6 e</ref>). Dramatic changes in the microstructure, relative to the WQ condition, occurred after compression deformation at 600 °C. In these specimens, a nano-meter-sized mixture of at least three phases was ob-served inside grains (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7 a</ref>). The different phases were recognized by different Z contrast on the BSE images. In particular, bright, gray and dark-color particles were clearly identified. Comparison of this microstructure with that obtained after annealing at 600 and 750 °C <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> suggests that the matrix (gray) is a BCC1 phase rich in Ti, and the bright phase is BCC3 phase rich in Nb and Ta, and that the dark phase Post-mortem TEM observations of samples deformed at 600 °C confirmed the presence of a fine, multi-phase microstructure (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7 b</ref>). Globular-like precipitates, as well as a low fraction of needle-like precipitates, were observed in the BCC matrix. The average diameter of the globular precipitates was 40 nm and the average length and thickness of the needles were 35 nm and 10 nm, respectively. Selected area diffraction patterns taken for three different zone axes of the BCC matrix phase (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7 c-e</ref>) showed additional reflections from the B2 phase (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7 c,</ref><ref type="figure">d</ref>) and ordered omega, AlZr 2 , phase (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7 d,</ref><ref type="figure">e</ref>). It can also be seen that these three phases are coherent to each other and that all the reflections from the BCC matrix also belong to the B2 and AlZr 2 phases. The ordered omega (AlZr 2 ) phase has a B8 2 (P6 3 /mmc) structure, which has been extensively investigated earlier in the Ti-Al-Nb and Zr-Al-Nb systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> . In our case, it appears in different rotational variants in the cubic matrix. The variants can be identified in each pattern (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7 c-e</ref>) and more particularly in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref> d with diffraction spots corresponding to four variants of the ⟨11-20 ⟩ and ⟨1-102 ⟩ zone axes <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> . The observation of the B8 2 phase by TEM is also in good agreement with the XRD results. Based on the relationships between the cubic B2 phase and the B8 2 structure, the lattice parameters a and c of the hexagonal phase can be expressed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">𝑎 𝐵 8 2 = √ 2 𝑎 𝐵2 and 𝑐 𝐵 8 2 = √ 3 𝑎 𝐵2 .</formula><p>Considering the B2 phase with a B2 = 341.9 pm gives 𝑎 𝐵 8 2 = 483.5 pm and 𝑐 𝐵 8 2 = 592.2 pm, which are in good agreement with experimental values, determined by XRD, of 𝑎 𝐴𝑙𝑍 𝑟 2 = 485.6 pm and 𝑐 𝐴𝑙𝑍 𝑟 2 = 589.7 pm (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">5 d</ref>). The observed correlation between the lattice parameters of the B2 and B8 2 phases confirms that the B8 2 phase was generated from the B2 phase, in agreement with the earlier findings <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> .</p><p>The B2/B8 2 phases appear as globules as shown by dark-field imaging (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8 a</ref>) with the average diameter of 40 nm. Needlelike precipitation was also observed in the deformed microstructure. Two families were highlighted in orthogonal directions by selecting streaks present in the &lt; 001 &gt; BCC/B2 zone axis and close to {110} BCC/B2 reflections (see Figs. 7 c, 8 b, and 8 c). This crystallographically-oriented precipitation is related to the spinodal decomposition of the cubic matrix during water quenching, and it is similar to the decomposition process earlier reported in Zr-Al-Nb systems <ref type="bibr">[18 , 19]</ref> . The spinodal decomposition leads to a modulated structure with composition changes along elastically soft ⟨100 ⟩ directions in the BCC structure. STEM-EDS elemental map of the microstructure is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9</ref> . The partitioning of elements clearly shows that globule-like precipitates were rich in Al and Zr. These precipitates were surrounded by the matrix in which a homogeneous repartition of Ti but also noticeable compositional variations of Nb, Ta and Zr were observed. Furthermore, compositional modulations (needle-like phase) seem to be rich in Zr. Semi-quantitative chemical analysis of the different observed phases is given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref> .</p><p>The SEM/BSE images from the specimen deformed at 800 °C showed a polygonal structure inside deformed grains (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">10 a</ref>) and the presence of fine, dynamically recrystallized grains at some grain boundaries of the deformed grains (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">10 b</ref>). Dark second-phase particles, rich in Al and Zr, were observed at grain boundaries and inside recrystallized grains. Their volume fraction was very low, less than 0.1%. STEM-EDS analysis of the deformed microstructure confirmed the partitioning of Al and Zr in large precipitates and along subgrain boundaries (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">10 c</ref>). These precipitates were often surrounded by areas enriched in Nb and Ta as shown in the bottom of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">10 c</ref>. The chemical composition of the precipitates and surrounding matrix is given in Table <ref type="table">5</ref> .  In addition to the presence of low fraction of the secondary phases, fine, nanometer-sized precipitates of the B2 phase in the BCC matrix were revealed by dark field imaging using a (100) super-lattice reflection (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">11 a</ref>). It is likely that these precipitates were formed during cooling the sample after deformation, as the similar microstructures were observed in the samples deformed at 1000 and 1200 °C, as well as in non-deformed WQ and SC samples <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> . Numerous subgrain boundaries were also evidenced by TEM (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">11 b,</ref><ref type="figure">c</ref>) and the simultaneous observation of low dislocation density in grains confirmed the recrystallization process during the compressive test at 800 °C.</p><p>A specimen deformed at 1000 °C had the microstructure consisting of large, non-recrystallized deformed grains with a subgrain structure inside them and dynamically recrystallized grains in the strain localization, heavily deformed regions-bands (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">12 a</ref>). These regions were inclined by ~50-60°to the compression direction. No second-phase precipitates were identified in the SEM images. A completely recrystallized structure was observed in the sample deformed at 1200 °C (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">12 b</ref>).</p></div>

These are (a) the range ≤ 400 °C, (b) the range between 400 and 600 °C, and (c) the range above 600 °C. Below, the deformation features in these three temperature regions are outlined and discussed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Mechanical behavior at temperatures from 23 to 400 °C</head><p>At RT (23 °C), mechanical properties of the Al 10 Nb 15 Ta 5 Ti 30 Zr 40 alloy in Cast, WQ and SC conditions are very comparable (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2 a</ref>), because these three conditions have similar, nano-meter-sized mixture of co-continuous BCC and B2 phases (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1 c</ref>). The element microsegregation observed in the Cast condition in the form of the dendritic structure has a very weak effect on the yield stress, although it slightly increases the strain hardening rate after yielding. On the other hand, the multi-phase structure produced after annealing at 600 °C (LTA condition, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1 d</ref>) has noticeably higher yield stress and strain hardening rate. This indicates that, in the studied alloy, precipitation strengthening from secondary (ordered) phases is more effective than the strengthening from the concentration fluctuations and partial ordering inside the BCC solid solution phase. The mechanical behavior of the partially ordered cubic matrix appears quite similar to that of ductile single-phase BCC solid solution RCCAs: high yield stress, low strain-hardening and good compressive ductility <ref type="bibr">[2 , 20 , 21]</ref> . The attractive yield strength can be explained by the compounding effects of a solid solution strengthening and the presence of ordered regions with possible pinning effects on dislocations (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1 c</ref>), while good ductility can be explained by the continuous nature of the disordered BCC phase <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> . A reduced ductility of the multi-phase LTA condition at 23 °C is likely due to the brittle nature of precipitated phases.</p><p>The observation of shear/dislocation bands after deformation at RT and 400 °C ( Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6 a,</ref><ref type="figure">b,</ref><ref type="figure">d</ref>) attests that the deformation mechanisms operate with the same signature. Moreover, the presence of a composite microstructure made of hard and soft zones (i.e. associated with a high and low dislocation density) could act as long range obstacles for mobile dislocations, leading to an increase in internal stresses and finally to strain hardening (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2 a</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> . A slight decrease in the yield stress and flow stress is observed with increasing temperature from 23 to 400 °C (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> ). This stress drop can be related to a decrease in the solid solution strengthening due to thermal activation.</p><p>Another interesting aspect is related to the large compressive ductility of Al 10 Nb 15 Ta 5 Ti 30 Zr 40 at all studied temperatures. Generally Al-containing refractory RCCAs, such as Al x HfNbTaTiZr <ref type="bibr">[23 , 24]</ref> Al x NbTaTiV <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> , Al x CrNbTiVZr <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> and Al-Mo-Nb-Ta-Ti-V-Zr <ref type="bibr">[9 , 14]</ref> , are very strong but have low ductility or even brittle at RT. The RT brittleness in these Al-containing RCCAs is caused by ordered intermetallic  phases, such as B2, Laves and Al x Zr y , which formation is facilitated through the chemical interactions of Al with other alloying elements <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> . For example, many of these alloys have an ordered B2 matrix, while a disordered BCC phase is discontinuous <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> . Recent publication by Soni et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> showed that RT ductility of some of the Al-containing RCCAs can be considerably improved by heat treatment which breaks continuity of the B2 phase and results in the formation of a disordered BCC matrix. Similarly, good RT ductility of Al 10 Nb 15 Ta 5 Ti 30 Zr 40 can also be explained by the presence of the continuous disordered BCC phase. However, Al addition seems to promote ordering effects in the same way as in other Al-containing RCCAs, as well as in Ti-Nb-Al and Zr-Nb-Al-based alloy systems. Furthermore, weak ordering of the B2 phase in the current alloy does not affect RT plasticity and plastic deformation probably occurs by the glide of a &lt; 111 &gt; or a/2 &lt; 111 &gt; dislocations <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> . By the analogy with some ductile B2 compounds in which the ⟨111 ⟩ slip is well-recognized to be a direct consequence of low ordering energy, the studied alloy likely has a relatively low critical temperature for ordering. Indeed, the nano-scale, co-continuous mixture of the BCC and B2 phases with similar compositions is evidenced at RT in the alloy samples annealed at 1100 °C (WQ and SC conditions), but it is absent during the following heating to 750 °C <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> , which indicates that the ordering process occurs at relatively low temperatures (likely below 750 °C) where the element redistributions between the phases and growth of B2 regions are restricted at the nanometer scale levels by slow diffusion kinetics of the alloying elements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Mechanical behavior at 400-600 °C</head><p>In this temperature range, Al 10 Nb 15 Ta 5 Ti 30 Zr 40 shows an anomalous increase in the yield stress with increasing temperature. Such behavior is quite unusual in BCC solid solutions but it was reported in some intermetallic compounds based on the BCC lattice <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> . However, in the referred publications, the presence of the stress anomaly was often attributed to super-dislocation reactions and formation of sessile ⟨100 ⟩ or ⟨110 ⟩ defects in the peak stress temperature range. This mechanism is excluded for the studied alloy considering the strong BCC character of the WQ and SC microstructure. In that respect, it appears reasonable to ascribe the increase in the yield stress in the 400-600 °C range to the decomposition of the parent phase. This phenomenon is due to the inherent instability of the quenched BCC phase in the Al 10 Nb 15 Ta 5 Ti 30 Zr 40 alloy in this temperature range <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> (see Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref> ). Taking into account that the melting temperature, T m , of Al 10 Nb 15 Ta 5 Ti 30 Zr 40 is 1598 °C (1871 K) <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> , the T / T m ratio (in the absolute temperature scale) approaches the values of 0.35 to 0.45 at T = 400-600 °C making diffusional effects no longer negligible. Therefore, the stress increase in this temperature range can be associated with the nucleation and growth of fine ordered secondary phases, which are expected in accord to the equilibrium phase diagram <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> and which are indeed observed after compression deformation at 600 °C (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref> ). The decrease in the solid solution strengthening effect with increasing temperature from 400 to 600 °C is more than compensated by an increase in the yield strength due to nucleation and growth of second-phase particles.</p><p>The strengthening effect from precipitated particles depends on their volume fraction, f , and average diameter, d <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> . When the particles are small, strengthening mechanisms related to particle cross-cutting by dislocations, such as coherency, modulus and order hardening, play primary role. In this case the precipitation strengthening contribution Δ𝜎 ps is proportional to ( df ) 0.5 , i.e. the strength increases with increasing particle diameter and volume fraction <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> . During the time period after all particles nucleate (particle density N is constant) but equilibrium is not achieved (volume fraction increased), Δ𝜎 ps ~d 2 . When f became constant, Δ𝜎 ps ~d 0.5 . Δ𝜎 ps reaches the maximum when d approaches a critical value d cr above which Orowan mechanism (dislocations bowing between the particles) controls precipitation strengthening contribution and Δ𝜎 ps is proportional to 1/ d , i.e. the strength decreases with increasing the particle diameter. Therefore, at a given temperature, at which the nucleation, growth and coarsening events occur, the precipitation strengthening contribution increases, reaches the maximum at d = d cr , and then decreases with time. Using this knowledge, the anomalous increase in the yield stress with increasing temperature from 400 °C to 600 °C can be explained by the cross-cutting strengthening mechanisms from precipitates, which nucleate and grow during heating to and holding at the temperature prior to testing, and which diameter does not exceed the critical diameter.</p><p>Plastic deformation is known to accelerate the precipitate coarsening <ref type="bibr">[30 , 34]</ref> . The evolution of the flow stress with plastic strain is related to an increase (or decrease) in the dislocation density (dislocation forest strengthening) and an increase in the precipitation particle diameter. The particle coarsening will increase (if the average particle diameter d retains below d cr ) or decrease (if d &gt; d cr ) the apparent deformation strengthening effect. Contribution of solid solution strengthening mechanism to the flow stress increment during deformation at a constant temperature is small. During the period of time when cross-cutting mechanisms operate, the precipitation and dislocation forest strengthening mechanisms work in one direction providing more extensive deformation strengthening than in the case when no dynamic precip-itate coarsening occurs. If the particles are above the critical diameter and continue noticeably growing during deformation, the precipitation strengthening contribution decreases with deformation and thus the apparent deformation strengthening effect also decreases. Moreover, if deformation starts at the particle size close to or slightly above d cr , the situation that is likely happens near 600 °C (see Section 4.4 below), the maximum precipitation strengthening effect is achieved at the beginning of deformation and it decreases continuously at later deformation stages. This decrease can be more pronounced than the dislocation forest strengthening and will result in the deformation softening. Additionally, during particle coarsening above d cr , dislocation forest density may not increase as rapidly as in the case of stable particles or no particles, but it can even decrease due to more possibilities for dislocation annihilation (recovery), as the effective distance between the particles increases. Thus shifting of the anomalous peak stress from 600 to 500 °C and a considerable flow stress decrease at 600 °C after plastic deformation with 𝜀 = 0.2, relative to the respective values at 𝜀 = 0.002 (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref> ), are likely due to, respectively, achieving the precipitate critical diameter at 500 °C and the particle coarsening much above their critical diameter, representing a typical over-aging phenomenon, at 600 °C.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Mechanical behavior above 600 °C</head><p>A significant decrease in the yield stress is observed for testing temperatures above the stress peak (600 °C). Such a decrease coincides with coarsening, dissolution and complete disappearance of the strengthening phases in the temperature range of 600-800 °C. In that respect, the yield stress relies on the behavior of the soft disordered BCC matrix for temperatures exceeding 0.45 T m leading to a significant stress fall beyond 600 °C. The presence of secondary phases has also been highlighted mainly along sub-grain boundaries after deformation at 800 °C. However, even it appears quite unclear if the observed phases are formed during compressive testing or during the cooling stage, the potential contribution of this precipitation to the alloy strengthening may probably be limited due to their low ( &lt; 0.1%) volume fraction.</p><p>The deformation behavior at T ≥ 600 °C is accompanied by two softening features: (a) the presence of sharp stress drop almost immediately after yielding and (b) a slow flow stress decrease or the occurrence of steady-state flow followed after the sharp stress drop. The presence of a large peak stress followed by sharp stress drop at the beginning of deformation can be a result of low mobility of dislocations present prior to deformation. For example, solute atmospheres and/or precipitates can form around dislocations during heating to the testing temperature. These solute atmospheres (or solute clouds) and/or precipitates increase dislocation resistance for glide, thus hindering dislocation mobility <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> . Additional stress is required for dislocations to escape the solute clouds thereafter leading to the rapid stress drop. This effect becomes weaker and may disappear with increasing temperature as the diffusion mobility of solutes increases and precipitates dissolve. The activation of dislocation sources at the upper stress point can be followed by the rapid multiplication of mobile dislocations, additionally contributing to the stress drop.</p><p>A slow flow stress decrease or the presence of a steady-state flow after the sharp stress drop during deformation at T ≥ 600 °C is likely related to strain-induced coarsening (600 °C) and dissolution (700 °C) of second phase particles and dislocation recovery and dynamic recrystallization clearly observed during deformation at T ≥ 800 °C. The presence of fine subgrain and fine grain structure after deformation confirms the activation of these softening processes at these temperatures (see Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">11</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">12</ref> ). Dynamic recovery and dynamic recrystallization effectively reduce the stored elastic energy by decreasing the density of immobile (forest) dislocations, refine grain structure and promote grain boundary sliding as an additional deformation mechanism thus reducing the flow stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> . In fact, it is well known phenomenon that above the so-called equicohesive temperature an inverse Hall-Petch relationship occurs, when the flow stress decreases with decreasing grain size because grain boundaries become effective sinks for dislocations <ref type="bibr">[36 , 37]</ref> .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.">Strengthening mechanisms 4.4.1. Temperature dependence of true yield stress</head><p>The yield stress of the Al 10 Nb 15 Ta 5 Ti 30 Zr 40 alloy at various temperatures can be considered as a sum of solid solution strengthening in the matrix, precipitation strengthening due to B2 like ordered precipitates and dislocation forest strengthening. The fourth common strengthening mechanism, grain-boundary strengthening, can be ignored because in the initial, WQ or SC, condition the alloy has large grains. The dislocation forest strengthening (DFS) is estimated as <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> :</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">Δ𝜎 df = 1 . 1 Gb 𝜌 0 . 5 .</formula><p>(</p><p>In Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">2</ref>) , b is the Burgers' vector value, G is the shear modulus, 𝜌 is the density of immobile dislocations, and the Taylor factor of 2.75 is used. With an increase in temperature, G decreases ( Eq. (1b) ) and b increases due to thermal expansion. To calculate b at a given temperature T , a linear thermal expansion coefficient CTE = 8.5 10 -6 K -1 determined using the rule of mixture of pure elements was used. The temperature dependence of G is stronger than that of b , which, at a given dislocation density, causes the DFS to decrease with increasing T. The dislocation density in the annealed metals is ~10 12 m -2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> . Therefore, using b o = 294 pm and G o = 44 GPa (see Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref> ), the DFS in the annealed alloy is estimated to be Δ𝜎 df o ≈ 14 MPa at 23 °C, it decreases with increasing temperature and becomes negligible at 1200 °C (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">6</ref> ).</p><p>During deformation at T ≥ 600 °C, a noticeable stress drop occurs immediately after yielding, which origin was discussed in the previous section and related to an additional stress required to move pinned dislocations present prior to deformation. We call this stress "dislocation unlocking stress " (DUS) and calculate it at each temperature as the difference between the peak stress and the stress immediately after the stress drop extrapolated to the respective peak stress strain. The DUS values are given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">6</ref> . The DUS contribution to the yield stress is rather high at 600 °C (195 MPa), 700 °C (145 MPa) and 800 °C (105 MPa), but it decreases to low values of 7.5 MPa and 2.2 MPa at 1000 °C and 1200 °C, respectively, which is likely related to a considerable increase in diffusivity of alloying elements with increasing temperature.</p><p>The solid solution strengthening (SSS) in the Al 10 Nb 15 Ta 5 Ti 30 Zr 40 alloy matrix was calculated using an adapted version of the Suzuki model described in detail elsewhere <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> . The lattice parameter, shear modulus and solute-a/2 &lt; 111 &gt; screw dislocation interaction energies, E int , required as input into the Suzuki model were determined using atomistic Zhou potentials <ref type="bibr">[41 , 42]</ref> and are given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">7</ref> . The calculated lattice parameter of the BCC matrix, ~342 pm, is in a reasonable agreement with the experiment. Using the parameters from Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">7</ref> , the SSS contributions to the yield stress at temperatures from 23 to 800 °C were calculated and the calculated values are given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">6</ref> . Because the Suzuki model calculations can only be valid at temperatures where diffusion processes are not active, the calculations were not conducted for 1000 and 1200 °C. For these two temperatures, the SSS contribution was estimated by subtracting the DFS contribution from the experimentally determined yield stress (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">6</ref> ). It can also be seen that the calculated SSS value at 800 °C (270 MPa) is higher than the experimentally determined yield stress at this temperature, which is an indication that the upper temperature limit of the Suzuki model for this alloy is below 800 °C. Because the sample deformed at 800 °C has essentially single-phase BCC structure, the SSS contribution at 800 °C (~246 MPa) was also estimated by subtracting the DFS contribution from the respective yield stress (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">6</ref> ). The precipitation strengthening (PS) contributions to the yield stress in this alloy at each temperature were then estimated by subtracting the SSS, DUS and DFS contributions from the respective yield stress values (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">6</ref> ). It can be seen that the PS contribution to the yield stress increases from ~335 MPa at 23 °C to ~634 MPa at 500 °C and then decreases to 537 MPa at 600 °C, 119 MPa at 700 °C and to zero at higher temperatures. The increase in the PS contribution with an increase in temperature from 23 to 500 °C is likely due to increasing the volume fraction f and average particle diameter d ; the latter reaches a critical value d c at T = 500 °C providing maximum precipitation strengthening at this temperature. The continuous decrease in the PS above 600 °C is caused by particle coarsening beyond d c and dissolution of the secondary phases. At T ≥ 800 °C the alloy becomes a single-phase BCC structure and the PS disappears (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">6</ref> ). This analysis indicates that the anomalous temperature dependence of the yield stress between 400 °C and 600 °C is the result of the simultaneous occurrence of the peak precipitation strengthening (at 500 °C) and maximum dislocation unlocking stress (at 600 °C).</p><p>At the average particle diameter d below its critical value d c , which corresponds to the maximum precipitation strengthening, (i.e. at temperatures ≤ 500 °C for the studied alloy) the PS contributions come from the modulus strengthening, coherency strengthening and order strengthening <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> . The estimations related to the Al 10 Nb 15 Ta 5 Ti 30 Zr 40 alloy however show that the main precipitation strengthening contri-bution is from the order strengthening, while the contribution from coherency strengthening is about two order of magnitude weaker and from the modulus strengthening is about one order of magnitude weaker (see Supplementary Materials). Therefore, order strengthening is considered as the main PS mechanism for the Al 10 Nb 15 Ta 5 Ti 30 Zr 40 alloy. The peak precipitation strengthening, 𝛿𝜎 p , can be related to the anti-phase boundary (APB) energy of the particles as <ref type="bibr">[38 , 39]</ref> </p><formula xml:id="formula_5">δσ p = 1 . 463(γ∕b) f 1∕2 ( 1 + C η 0 ) (<label>3</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_6">)</formula><p>where 𝛾 is the APB energy, f is the volume fraction of particles, b is the Burgers vector of a/2 &lt; 111 &gt; dislocations, 𝜂 0 at peak strengthening is ~(f/ 𝜋) 0.5 and C = 2/3 for 𝜂 0 &lt; 1. Taylor factor M = 2.75 is used in Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">3</ref>) . Note that Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">3</ref>) assumes that the precipitate particles are defeated by a pair of a/2 &lt; 111 &gt; screw dislocations and it also includes the Labusch's correction <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> . Taking 𝛿𝜎 p = 634 MPa, f = 0.36 and b = 296 pm at T = 500 °C, the APB energy of the particles is estimated to be a relatively low value of 176 mJ/m 2 . At this APB energy, coherency strains of the order of 0.3% have very little effect on precipitation strengthening <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> and, therefore, neglecting coherency strain strengthening is reasonable. Using the calculated 𝛾 = 176 mJ/m 2 , the critical diameter, d c , at which the peak yield stress is achieved, is estimated within this model as <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> 𝑑 c = 0 . 78w(2Γ∕γ)</p><p>where w is of the order of unity, and Γ is the line tension of dislocations.</p><p>The line tension of screw dislocations within isotropic elasticity theory can be written down as <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> </p><formula xml:id="formula_8">Γ = 2G( b 2 ∕4π) ln ( r e ∕b )<label>(5)</label></formula><p>G is the shear modulus and r e is the outer cut-off radius.

Eqs.

The APB energies for conventional B2 structures, such as FeAl and NiAl, are ~300 and 800 mJ/m 2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref> , while the estimated APB energy for the studied alloy is noticeably smaller, which may explain good ductility observed for this alloy <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref> .

Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_9">6</ref>) is in agreement with <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref> . For a precipitation strengthening of ~335 MPa at RT, the diameter of the particles, from solving Eqs. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_9">6</ref>) , and -(8) iteratively, is estimated to be ~3.3 nm, which is in reasonable agreement with the size of B2 domains observed experimentally at RT as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1 c</ref>. If now we assume that the precipitates are overcome by single a/2 &lt; 111 &gt; dislocations, rather than pairs, the critical diameter is reached when the dislocation transitions from cutting the precipitates to Orowan bowing <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> . For the precipitate cutting stress, in this case, Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_9">6</ref>) can be used with the factor 0.941 doubled to 1.882 <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> . The Orowan bowing stress, for screw dislocations, 𝛿𝜎 o , in the isotropic elasticity approximation, can be calculated as <ref type="bibr">[30 , 31]</ref> :</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">δσ o = Gb ∕ [ 2πL p (1 -ν) ] ln ( 2 d av ∕b )[ ln ( 2 d av ∕b ) ∕ ln ( L o ∕b )] 0 . 5<label>(9)</label></formula><p>where L p = d (0.724f -0.  <ref type="formula" target="#formula_13">9</ref>) by solving it iteratively. Equating the Orowan stress to the peak stress of 634 MPa, the critical diameter d cr in this case is calculated to be ~115 nm. From Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_9">6</ref>) , the APB energy for the single dislocation cutting model turns out to be ~72 mJ/m 2 . Since the critical diameter with the single dislocation cutting model, 115 nm, is much larger than the experimentally observed diameter of particles after 50% compressive deformation at 600 °C, 40 nm, it is concluded that the B2 particles are cut by pairs of a/2 &lt; 111 &gt; screw dislocations in this alloy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>4.4.2.</head><p>Temperature dependence of the flow stress at 𝜀 = 0.2 Plastic deformation generally results in an increase in the dislocation density and it also accelerates phase transformation and second-phase precipitate coarsening <ref type="bibr">[34 , 37]</ref> . Therefore, the contributions of DFS and PS mechanisms to the flow stress should depend on the plastic strain. Here we estimate the contributions of different strengthening mechanisms to the true flow stress 𝜎 20 at the true strain 𝜀 = 0.2. First, it is reasonable to assume that at any given temperature the SSS contribution does not change with deformation and at 𝜀 = 0.2 the SSS is the same as at 𝜀 = 0.002 (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">6</ref> ). Second, it is assumed that the diffusion activity at 23 °C is negligible and no changes in the phase composition of the alloy occur during deformation at 23 °C. Therefore, the PS contribution does not change with deformation at T = 23 °C. Then the 182 MPa flow stress increase at 23 °C after 𝜀 = 0.2 is due to an increase in the dislocation density. Using Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">2</ref>) , the dislocation density at 𝜀 = 0.2 is estimated to be 𝜌 20 = 1.9 10 14 m 2 . Assuming that the same dislocation density is produced after deformation with 𝜀 = 0.2 at other temperatures, up to 700 °C, the DFS contributions at different temperatures are calculated using Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">2</ref>) and known temperature dependences of G and b , and the calculated values are given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">6</ref> . It can be seen that DFS decreases continuously from 196 MPa at 23 °C to 118 MPa at 500 °C and to 86 MPa at 700 °C. Due to extensive dynamic recovery and dynamic recrystallization at T ≥ 800 °C resulting in a steady state flow, it is assumed that the dislocation density (and thus DFS) at these high temperatures retains unchanged and it is the same as in the annealed alloy. The PS contribution at 𝜀 = 0.2 is calculated as the remaining part of the flow stress 𝜎 20 , and the calculated values at different testing temperatures are given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">6</ref> . It can be seen from Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">6</ref> that after deformation with 𝜀 = 0.2 the PS contribution slightly increases at 250 and 400 °C, retains nearly the same at 500 °C and considerably decreases at 600 and 700 °C. This analysis indicates that the critical precipitate diameter is achieved after heating and deformation at 500 °C. The alloy conditions at T ⟨ 500 °C correspond to underaging and result in the flow stress increase with increasing holding time and strain. The conditions at T ⟩ 500 °C correspond to overaging and cause the flow strain decrease with increasing holding time and strain.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusions</head><p>In this work, an aluminum-containing refractory high entropy alloy, which has excellent combination of the room temperature ductility and strength, as well as low density (6.48 ± 0.03 g/cm 3 ) has been reported. In the as-cast condition, 1100 °C annealed and slow cooled condition and 1100 °C annealed and water quenched condition, the alloy has almost the same room temperature yield stress of ~1050 MPa and compression ductility over 50%. Long-time annealing at 600 °C increases RT yield stress to 1175 MPa but decreases compressive ductility.</p><p>The temperature dependence of the yield stress of the alloy shows anomalous behavior in the temperature range of 400-600 °C, where yield stress increases with an increase in temperature and at 600 °C the yield stress of the alloy is the same as at room temperature. Above 600 °C, the yield stress decreases rapidly with an increase in temperature to 250 MPa at 800 °C and below 50 MPa at 1000 and 1200 °C.</p><p>The observed mechanical properties directly relate to the microstructure of the alloy. After annealing at 1100 °C followed by continuous cooling to room temperature, the alloy has a coarse-grained BCC structure consisting of co-continuous two-phase mixture of BCC and B2 with small enrichment of Al and Zr in the B2 phase. In the temperature range of 400-600 °C, an additional ordered phase, AlZr 2 , forms and a mixture of the three phases form after deformation at 600 °C. Above 600 °C, the volume fraction of the secondary phases rapidly decreases with increasing temperature and the alloy becomes single-phase BCC above 800 °C.</p><p>It is suggested that the anomalous yield stress peak observed at 600 °C is related to precipitate growth and coarsening and achieving critical particle diameter that provides the maximum precipitation strengthening effect. A rapid drop in the stress at higher temperatures is due to particle coarsening beyond the critical diameter, dissolution of the secondary phases and loss in precipitation and solid solution strengthening.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
