<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This study developed a series of refractory Al x HfNbTaTiZr high-entropy alloys (HEAs) with an aim to improve strength, and reduce density of the very ductile base alloy HfNbTaTiZr. Despite the diversity of crystal structures among the constituent elements, all the HEAs are single solid solution phase with body-centered cubic (BCC) structure. The addition of Al significantly improves the strength but reduces the ductility due to large solution hardening. The linear relation between yield strength and atomic percentage of Al suggests that the strengthening effect of a certain element in a single-phase HEA alloy can be explained based on quasi-binary alloy concept.</p><p>Crack formations in deformed AlHfNbTaTiZr alloy with the lowest fracture strain are mainly along the boundaries between dendrite and interdendrite.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Materials for high temperature applications, such as those in aerospace and petrochemical industries, are in high demand. Due to the incipient melting point at around 1300 o C, Ni-based superalloys have their applicability only up to temperatures between 1160 and 1277 o C <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>. Various alloys based on refractory metal elements having melting point higher than 1650 o C, such as niobium and tantalum alloys, might provide a practical solution to this problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. It is because alloy softening does not generally occur until temperature exceeds 0.5 to 0.6 T m <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, at which the material becomes susceptible to thermally activated deformation. Unfortunately, these two refractory alloy systems show high densities, poor oxidation resistance, and poor ductility at elevated temperatures. In considering the benefits of high-entropy and sluggish diffusion effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> which respectively enhance the formation of solid solution phase, and slow down the diffusion rate and thus creep rate, HEAs with suitable composition are considered as a good candidate to high-temperature applications. In recent years, Senkov et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref> proposed a refractory metal design concept to develop new alloys aimed at overcoming the temperature limitation of superalloys <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>, which are named as refractory HEAs. The first two researches revealed that NbMoTaW and VNbMoTaW refractory HEAs possess a simple body-centered cubic (BCC) microstructure and pronounced solution hardening <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref>. Both alloys still have yield strengths of 405 and 477 MPa at 1600 °C, respectively. However, their drawbacks include much higher density than 9.0 g/cm 3   and room-temperature brittleness. Later, they published the BCC alloy of HfNbTaTiZr <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref> with slightly lower strength than the first two refractory HEAs but having excellent ductility exceeding 50 %. However, this alloy still has a density higher than 9.0 g/cm 3 . Apparently, this alloy is unique in its large room-temperature ductility since BCC-HEAs are seldom ductile. In addition, this alloy also has quite high strength at elevated temperatures and thus is promising for high temperature applications. This finding has led researchers to investigate microstructure and properties of other refractory HEAs with various molar ratios of their constituent elements <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</p><p>Among these, Senkov et al. reported four high-hardness and low-density refractory HEAs of the Cr-Nb-Ti-V-Zr system <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> and two Al-containing refractory HEAs: AlMo 0.5 NbTa 0.5 TiZr and Al 0.4 Hf 0.6 NbTaTiZr <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. It was noted that the addition of Al could stabilize the bcc crystal structure and help to reduce the density of the refractory HEAs. The partial substitution of Hf with Al in the HfNbTaTiZr alloy was shown to reduce the density of the alloys by ∼9%, increase the RT hardness by 29% and enhance yield strength by 98%. On the other hand, complete substitution of Cr with Al in the CrMo 0.5 NbTa 0.5 TiZr alloy reduced the alloy density by 10.1%, increased RT hardness and yield strength by 12%, noticeably improved RT ductility and considerably increased, by more than 50%, high-temperature strength in the temperature range from1073 K to 1473 K. Therefore, it is realized that Al addition could bring positive effects on the microstructure and properties of such refractory HEAs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Based on the above consideration, this study selected Al for incorporation into</head><p>HfNbTaTiZr for various kinds of benefits including lower density, and higher strength with adequate ductility. The evolution of microstructure, mechanical properties and fracture behavior of refractory Al x HfNbTaTiZr HEAs with the variation of x from 0 to 1 were investigated and discussed. Our aim has two more purposes: (1) to verify the ability of producing a single phase refractory solid solution with the addition of Al and (2) to optimize the Al content with best properties and provide a reference for further tuning the composition.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Experimental procedures</head><p>Bulk Al x HfNbTaTiZr refractory HEAs with various quantities of Al ( x = 0, 0.3, 0.5, 0.75, and 1.0), also simply denoted by Al 0 , Al 0.3 , Al 0.5 , Al 0.75 , and Al 1.0 , respectively which were prepared in a vacuum arc melting furnace under a high-purity argon atmosphere. Ingots were obtained in a copper mould. The purity of all raw elemental materials was better than 99.99 wt%. Each sample was reversed and re-melted four times in order to assure chemical homogeneity. The final samples were button-shaped, approximately 8 mm thick, with a shiny surface. The microstructure and chemical composition of the alloys were analyzed by scanning electron microscope (SEM, JEOL JEOL JSM-5410) and energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS).</p><p>The crystal structures of the as-cast specimens were identified by X-ray diffraction (XRD, D/Max2500 V) using Cu K α radiation. Grain size was measured by the linear intercept method from micrographs taken by an optical microscope (OM, Olympus BX51M). Vickers hardness measurements were conducted using a MATSUZAWA SEIKI MV-1 hardness tester under a load of 10 kgf with the duration of 15 s. Seven measurements on each specimen were done to obtain an average. Room temperature compression tests were performed using an Instron 4468 machine under a strain rate of 10 -3 /s. In this test, we employed at least two cylindrical specimens 3 mm in diameter and 5 mm in length for each alloy, and put Teflon interface layers in-between specimen and platen for minimizing the friction and barrel effect.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Results and discussion</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Crystal structure and density</head><p>X-ray diffraction patterns of HfNbTaTiZr, Al 0.3 HfNbTaTiZr, Al 0.5 HfNbTaTiZr, Al 0.75 HfNbTaTiZr, and AlHfNbTaTiZr alloys are presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">1</ref>. All peaks in the X-ray patterns are shown to be in agreement with a single BCC crystal structure with the exception that AlHfNbTaTiZr alloy has additional diffraction peaks. The exception was confirmed with three samples. It is thought to be originated from the interdendrite region which has relatively large Al segregation and a BCC structure with smaller lattice constant (see Section 3.3). All the peaks of BCC structure were also used to determine the lattice constants with a high degree of accuracy according to Bragg's law: HfNbTaTiZr (a = 3. 414 ± 0.001Å), Al 0.3 HfNbTaTiZr (a = 3.404 ± 0.001Å), Al 0.5 HfNbTaTiZr (a = 3.391 ± 0.001Å), Al 0.75 HfNbTaTiZr (a = 3.372 ± 0.001Å), and AlHfNbTaTiZr (a = 3.361 ± 0.001Å for Nb,Ta-rich dendrite and a = 3.292 ± 0.001Å for Al,Hf,Zr-rich interdendrite, see Section 3.3), as shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. Thus, the addition of Al reduces the lattice constants of the Al x HfNbTaTiZr alloys. The lattice constant of HfNbTaTiZr has been reported to be a = 3.409 Å <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref> and a = 3.401 Å <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, respectively. Thus, the present lattice constant is slight higher than the reported data by a percentage within 0.4%.</p><p>The differences between the five alloys with regard to the relative intensities of these peaks are mainly due to the effects of cast texture under the excitation of a small number of grains within the illuminated volume by X-rays. All alloys except AlHfNbTaTiZr having two BCC structures display a single BCC structure. This indicates that the addition of Al does not change the BCC structure. This is not surprising when considering the tendency of Al to form strong BCC structure. It is well-known that although Al is an FCC element, it interacts with transition metal with hybrid pd-orbital and enhances the directional bonding for BCC structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</p><p>The p-orbitals (filled) of Al as well as their high electron density and high Fermi level tend to promote the transfer of electrons to transition metals (TMs) with d-orbitals (partially filled), such as Ti, Zr, Nb and Hf. This results in the formation of covalent bonds in which Al-TM bonds are significantly shorter than the sum of the corresponding metallic radii. Because the TMs only have a partially filled d-shell, they contribute to only a general increase in covalency due to hybridization of the pd-orbitals, which leads to the formation of a BCC structure.</p><p>The formation of simple BCC solid solutions in these alloys again confirms the effect of high mixing entropy (∆S mix ), which significantly reduces the Gibbs free energy of mixing (∆G mix) and provides greater stability in the formation of random solid solutions instead of intermetallic compounds or other ordered phases during solidification. The Hume-Rothery rules would predict large phase separation in these alloys even at high temperatures near melting range since their composing elements differ significantly in valence number (3 for Al, 4 for Hf, Ti and Zr, and 5 for Nb and Ta), in crystal structure (Al is FCC and Hf, Ti and Zr are HCP which transforms into BCC at high temperatures), and atomic size (the group of Al, Nb, Ta and Ti, and the group of Hf and Zr have atomic size differences around 9 %) as seen in Table 1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. Obviously, the Hume-Rothery rules with similar crystal structure, valence, and electronegativity, and small atomic size difference (&lt; 15 %) for extended solubility can be relaxed to some extent due to the effects of high mixing entropy.</p><p>Using the rule-of-mixtures approach, theoretical lattice constants (a mix ) of an alloy can be estimated as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">mix i i a c a = ∑</formula><p>where c i and a i are atomic fraction and lattice constant of element i, respectively.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> presents the lattice constants of elements, calculated results as well as the values obtained from X-ray diffraction. The lattice constants of elements except Al are from the research of Senkov et al. on similar alloy, in which the determination of lattice constants was fully discussed <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. Because the lattice constant of BCC-Al cannot found in the literature, its lattice constant, 3.302 Å, is calculated from its atomic radius, 1.430 Å, in FCC-Al by using the closest atom packing approach. The theoretical lattice constants are calculated by substituting the actual overall compositions obtained by large-area EDS analyses (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">3</ref>) into the above equation. The standard deviation, ± 0.01, has included the typical accuracy, ± 0.0005 atom fractions, of EDS analyses and the expanded accuracy range due to summation and multiplication in the equation. In addition, theoretical lattice constants are calculated by substituting the designed compositions. The standard deviation, ± 0.001, is from the lattice constant data of each element <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. It can be seen that both theoretical lattice constants based on designed composition and analyzed composition have similar values and thus similar trend. Moreover, the differences between calculated and experimental lattice constants of the Al x HfNbTaTiZr alloy are within 0.6 % indicating the rule of mixtures holds well. This is a good indication that the BCC structure is a fully disordered solid solution. In addition, the percentages of difference between calculated lattice constants based on analyzed compositions and experimental lattice constants for the Al 0 , Al 0.3 , Al 0.5 , and Al 0.75 are + 0.12 %, + 0.12 %, -0.26 %, and -0.53 %, respectively (not consider Al 1.0 which has two BCC phases)</p><p>indicating that higher Al content would result in even smaller lattice constant.</p><p>Similarly, those between calculated lattice constants based on designed compositions and experimental lattice constants for the Al 0 , Al 0.3 , Al 0.5 , and Al 0.75 are + 0.29 %, + 0.18 %, -0.12 %, and -0.56 %, respectively. These two similar trends provide a good evidence of the effect of the strong bonding between Al and other constituent elements, as shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">2</ref> because the strong bonding could reduce the bond length and thus the lattice constant <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. This finding is also consistent with the discussion on hybrid pd-orbital formation between Al and TMs mentioned above. The formations of such covalent bonds are significantly shorter than the sum of the corresponding metallic radii <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</p><p>The density values of Al x HfNbTaTiZr alloys (both theoretical and experimental) are also presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. Al addition indeed brings one important benefit in effectively reducing the actual density from 9.72 to 8.91 g/cm 3 . The theoretical densities (ρ mix ) of the alloy were calculated with the rule of mixtures:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">i i mix i i i c A c A ρ ρ = ∑ ∑</formula><p>where A i and ρ i are the atomic weight and density of element i. For the theoretical density based on analyzed composition, they are calculated by substituting the actual overall compositions obtained by large-area EDS analyses (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">3</ref>). The standard deviation, ± 0.01, has included the typical accuracy, ± 0.0005 atom fractions, of EDS analyses and the expanded accuracy range due to summation and multiplication in the equation. In addition, theoretical densities are calculated by substituting the designed compositions. The standard deviation, ± 0.01, is from the hardness data of each element. It can be found that both theoretical data show similar trend as Al content increases. Besides this, the higher measured densities of Al-containing alloys and the increased density difference with increasing Al content also confirm the effect of strong bonding between Al and other constituent elements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Hardness analysis</head><p>The Vickers hardness values (Hv) of Al x HfNbTaTiZr HEAs are tabulated in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> and plotted as Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">2</ref>. The addition of Al increases the hardness of Al x HfNbTaTiZr alloys. This could be firstly explained by the difference in atomic size, which can induce significant localized lattice distortion and has a contribution to solution hardening. From Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>, Al has an atomic radius similar to those of Nb, Ti, and Ta, but distinctly smaller than that of Hf and Zr. According to the following equation, which is commonly used for the calculation of overall differences in atomic size, ߜ <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref>, the ߜ with an amplifying factor 100 for Al 0 to Al 1.0 alloys are 3.03, 3.09, 3.12, 3.15 and 3.17, respectively. These small values indicate the present BCC phase is essentially disordered solid solution since Guo et. al found that disordered solid solutions should form when ߜ &lt; 0.066 <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref>. Furthermore, the increase of ߜ agrees with the increasing trend of hardness. </p><formula xml:id="formula_2">n i i i r c r δ = = - ∑ where 1 n i i i r c r = =</formula><p>∑ , and c i and r i are the atomic fraction and atomic radius of element i.</p><p>In addition, the distinctly strong bonds between Al and the constituent transition metals, as shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">2</ref>, also have a strong hardening effect. To reveal this factor, the rule-of-mixtures approach is used to predict the theoretical hardness values (Hv mix ) of an alloy with the following equation:   <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> that the experimental hardness values are much higher than the theoretical values.</p><p>Moreover, the increase in hardness ranges from 2.5 to 4. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Microstructure and composition analysis</head><p>As-cast specimens of Al x HfNbTaTiZr alloys have been observed under optical microscope to evaluate the grain size by linear intercept method. The Al 0 , Al 0. respectively. At x = 0, the bright dendrite region is enriched with Nb and Ta, while the dark and gray interdendrite region is enriched with Hf, Ti, and Zr, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref> (a). This segregation trend is similar to that analyzed for the same alloy <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref>. At x = 0.3 to 1.0, Al segregates to interdendrite region and intensifies with increased Al addition. In contrast, Ta and Nb concentrations in dendrite region are increased relative to interdendrite region correspondingly. It is interesting to note that Ti shows less segregation between dendrite and interdendrite region as compared with other elements and becomes lesser segregation with increased Al addition. The observed partitioning of elements in the present alloys could be attributed to two main factors: differences in the melting point (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>) and the driving of bonding energy (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">2</ref>). Ta, Nb-rich dendrite first forms simply because these two elements were the highest two in melting points. This was also used to explain the segregation of highest-melting-point elements in the dendrite of refractory alloys <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref>. According to phase diagram, dendrite forms from liquid phase to solid-liquid phase field.</p><p>Subsequent, solidification would complete from solid-liquid region into solid phase region. Therefore, the solid-liquid region of the present alloys would be between Nb, Ta-rich solid phase and Nb, Ta-depleted liquid phase. On the other hand, Al has the lowest melting point and stronger bonding with Hf, Ti, and Zr, both factors enhance Al segregation into interdendrite. This suggests that solvus boundary of the hyperspace phase diagram encompasses from Nb, Ta-rich solid at higher temperatures to Al, Hf, Ti-rich solid at lower temperatures. However, the bonding between Al and Ti is less than that of Al-Hf and Al-Zr. As a result, Ti shows lesser segregation as Al content increases.</p><p>The extra diffraction peaks existing in XRD pattern of AlHfNbTaTiZr could be explained now. As aluminum content in the dendrite of this alloy is 6.8 at.% and that in the interdendrite is 19.6 at.% (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">3</ref>), their theoretical lattice constants based on the rule of mixtures can be calculated to be 3.378 ± 0.002Å and 3.418 ± 0.001Å, respectively. The deviation between these two is 1.2 %. However, experimental lattice constants of dendrite and interdendrite are 3.361 ± 0.001Å and 3.292 ± 0.001Å, respectively and have a reversed mutual deviation of 2.1 %. This deviation becomes large enough to be resolved in XRD pattern. Furthermore, this reversed deviation again confirms the strong bonding effect between Al and other constituent elements since higher Al content significantly enhances the reduction of lattice constant. This is reasonable because stronger bond strength could result in shorter bond length and thus smaller lattice constant <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33]</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.1">Stress-strain curves</head><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>   In the single BCC structure of Al x HfNbTaTiZr HEAs, each atom can be regarded as a solute atom and thus the matrix is whole-solute. Nevertheless, variations in the size and properties of these solute atoms enable them to elastically distort the crystal lattice, introducing local elastic stress fields. Since the interactions among these local elastic stress fields and the stress field of dislocations can hinder dislocation movements, it can be expected that this whole-solute matrix would give a large solution hardening effect as compared with conventional matrix based on one major element. In conventional alloy, the relationship between strengthening (∆σ) and solute concentration (c) is generally expressed as <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">n c σ α ∆</formula><p>where n ≈ 0.5. In present HEAs, Al concentration in the alloy can be calculated by c =</p><p>x/(5+x) if we treat Al x HfNbTaTiZr HEAs as quasi-binary alloy, i.e., Al x -(HfNbTaTiZr). Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">5</ref> shows yield strength as a function of c. It can be seen that the distribution of data fits a linear line very well and can be expressed by the following equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">σ = 1031+ 26.1 c(MPa)</formula><p>This shows that yield strength increases linearly with the concentration of Al in the alloy. Because the grain sizes from microstructure observation are in the same order as observed in Section 3.3, grain size strengthening effect by Hall-Petch equation could be neglected. Therefore, this linear relationship suggests that if we want to see the strengthening effect of a certain element in a single-phase HEA alloy, quasi-binary alloy concept might be used. The effect is linear by nature as long as no second phase forms. Besides this, it is noted that the partitioning of Al in the as-cast structure has no obvious effect on the linear relationship. This further suggests that the lattice distortion, Young's modulus, strength, and strengthening of dendritic solid solution and interdendritic one could be averaged as if the composition is uniform throughout the material. The fact of linearity is thus originated from the strengthening contribution per Al atom. This proportionality especially reflects the randomness of Al atoms in the solid solution, which is consistent with the conclusion drawn from the discussion on lattice constant and density in Section 3.1.</p><p>Senkov et al. made theoretical derivations based on the atomic size misfit and modulus misfit of atoms in solutes and solvents in order to explain the high degree of solution hardening observed in HfNbTaTiZr <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. Treating this material as a quasi-binary alloy in which Ta, Nb, and Ti were solvents and 40 at.% of Hf plus Zr were solutes led to a predicted yield strength of 1094 MPa, which was in reasonable agreement with the observed value of 929 MPa. It is interesting to note that their prediction of yield strength of HfNbTaTiZr is very close to the 1073 ± 6 MPa obtained in this study (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">4</ref>). This means that their derivation and prediction are accurate for this alloy if the present data is considered. Obviously, their model for the strengthening reason of one composition, HfNbTaTiZr, cannot be applied to the present alloy series since Al having distinctly strong bonding with other constituent elements is varied in content. In the present alloy series, strong bonding factor becomes a new contributor to the strengthening, which in combination with atomic-size-difference factor (or lattice distortion), follows linearity with Al content. This suggests that homogenization might improve the concentration difference, stress concentration, and thus the overall ductility.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Conclusions</head><p>Al has been selected to improve the strength and reduce the density of very ductile BCC HfNbTaTiZr alloy. The resulting Al x HfNbTaTiZr alloys (x = 0, 0.3, 0.5, 0.75, and 1.0) maintain a single BCC solid solution with typical dendritic structures in its as-cast state. The addition of Al increased the compressive yield strength from 1073 ± 6 MPa to 1489 ± 7 MPa; however, ductility was reduced from &gt; 50 to 21 %.</p><p>The increase in yield strength can be attributed to solid solution strengthening resulting from increased lattice distortion and stronger bonding between Al and constituent transition metals. The solution hardening shows a linear relation between yield strength and atomic percentage of Al, which suggests that the explanation of strengthening effect of a certain element in a single-phase HEA alloy can use quasi-binary alloy concept and the effect is linear as long as no second phase forms.</p><p>The decrease in ductility can be attributed to the effect of increased strength which hinders plastic deformation. Crack formations in AlHfNbTaTiZr alloy with the lowest fracture strain are mainly along the boundaries between dendrite and interdendrite.</p><p>This indicates that there is large deformation difference and thus stress concentration between dendrite and interdendrite, agreeing with the large deviation of Al content and thus strength between dendrite and interdendrite.</p></div>

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_4"><head>Al 0. 4</head><label>4</label><figDesc>HfNbTaTiZr alloy. The strength and fracture strain of the latter alloy are 1247 MPa, and &gt; 46%, respectively by taking the average from Al 0.3 HfNbTaTiZr and Al 0.5 HfNbTaTiZr alloys. The discrepancy could be attributable to their different compositions, and processing. The difference in composition is better revealed by atomic percentage: Al 7.5 Hf 18.5 Nb 18.5 Ta 18.5 Ti 18.5 Zr 18.5 versus Al 8 Hf 12 Nb 20 Ta 20 Ti 20 Zr 20 . Each component differs in percentage in these two alloys. Besides, the present alloys were investigated in the as-cast state whereas Al 0.4 Hf 0.6 NbTaTiZr alloy was HIPed at 1473 K and 207 MPa for 2 h, then annealed at 1473 K for 24 h in continuously flowing high-purity argon, and finally cooled at a rate of 10 K min -1 . Because the difference in total mixing enthalpy is small between Al 0.4 Hf 0.6 NbTaTiZr and Al 0.4 HfNbTaTiZr alloy based on Table 2 and cannot account for the discrepancy of strength, homogenization to maximize solution hardening and/or slow cooling to induce precipitation hardening might be the possible factors. However, it needs further study to clarify the mechanisms.</figDesc></figure>
