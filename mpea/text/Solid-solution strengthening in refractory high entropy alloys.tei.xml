<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Compression stress-strain curves of a number of refractory high entropy alloys (RHEAs) were generated at temperatures ranging from room temperature to 1000 C. It is shown that solid-solution strengthening in these alloys has both an athermal and a thermal component. Results from mechanical testing are combined with literature data to develop solid-solution strengthening models for both components that incorporate the particularities of single-phase body centered cubic (BCC) materials. The athermal component is affected by a combination of atomic size mismatch and elastic modulus mismatch, which depend upon average values from each alloy, thereby allowing this component to be estimated in a highthroughput fashion. On the other hand, the thermally-activated yield stress component does not correlate with any parameter that can be calculated by averaging pure elemental atomic properties and it is observed to be larger than the values found for pure BCC refractory metals and their dilute alloys. Overall, RHEAs are found to have larger thermal and athermal yield stress components compared to pure or conventional refractory alloys, which explains their relatively high strengths at room temperature.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>High entropy alloys (HEAs) are mixtures of multiple elemental constituents in near equimolar concentrations <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref> and are different from conventional alloys in that they have no principal solvent element. The literature focus to date has been largely on equiatomic HEAs [3e11], as well as some non-equiatomic alloys that have interesting combinations of properties <ref type="bibr">[12e15]</ref>. In fact, it has been shown that some non-equiatomic compositions <ref type="bibr">[16e18]</ref> have better properties than their equiatomic counterparts.</p><p>Searching for optimal compositions in the vast and mostly unexplored multicomponent space is challenging, since there is an almost infinite number of possible compositions. If alloy design is attempted by conventional methods, an unfeasible number of experiments is necessary to describe a single alloy system. Alternative methods, such as composition-dependent, high-throughput predictive models, are desirable for reducing the number of necessary experiments dramatically. Recently, Coury et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref> applied a high-throughput alloy design methodology for finding singlephase face centered cubic (FCC) alloys with optimized solid-solution strengthening. This methodology was applied to the CrMnFeCoNi family and the Cr 45 Co 27.5 Ni 27.5 alloy was designed and determined to be ~50% stronger than the strongest alloy reported previously for this system, namely, Cr 33.3 Co 33.3 Ni 33.3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref>.</p><p>Conventional refractory metals and most RHEAs are either single-phase body centered cubic (BCC) metallic solid solutions or contain a significant amount of a simple BCC phase at room temperature <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref>. Therefore, modeling the yield stress of RHEAs needs to incorporate the particularities of BCC metals <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>. Conventional BCC metals and alloys typically contain screw dislocations with non-planar cores that require relatively high stresses to glide by a double-kink mechanism that is thermally activated <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref>. At sufficiently high temperatures, the thermal energy aids this process, resulting in a relatively constant yield stress; this temperature regime is called the athermal yield stress plateau in textbooks and literature. This plateau is affected by solid-solution strengthening <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref>. At even higher temperatures, the BCC alloys again display a pronounced temperature dependence, which is due to long-range, thermally-activated mechanisms. This high temperature regime is more often studied from a processing or creep perspective, and is outside the scope of this work.</p><p>In FCC HEAs, the deformation sequence and the underlying mechanism for solid solution strengthening were shown to be similar to the behavior observed in conventional FCC alloys <ref type="bibr">[26e30]</ref>. The atomic size mismatch was shown to dominate [26e29], and the typical activation volumes are of the same order of magnitude as observed in conventional alloys <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. In BCC HEAs, the activation volumes are also in the same order of magnitude <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>; however, the edge dislocations are shown to also have a role in the deformation process of concentrated solid solutions <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33]</ref>. This led Maresca and Curtin <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> to recently develop a model for solid solution strengthening of RHEAs based on edge dislocations, where they considered atomic size mismatch as the main mechanism for strengthening; their resulting model predicts no athermal plateau, which they attributed to a dynamic strain aging effect.</p><p>Experimentally, a series of results <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36]</ref> in BCC RHEAs has indicated that the yield stress-temperature trend is similar to conventional BCC metals and alloys. The normalized yield stress vs. temperature is plotted in Fig. <ref type="figure">S1</ref> in the Supplementary Materials section for five RHEAs from the literature. As seen in the figure, all RHEAs have the same three temperature regimes, namely, at low and high temperature ranges, the yield stress is strongly temperature dependent, while for intermediate temperatures, an athermal plateau is observed. Chen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> have experimentally determined the onset of the athermal regime for some RHEAs, further confirming the similarities with conventional BCC alloys. Usually, the yield strength of these RHEAs is studied either at room temperature, which can be considered a low temperature with respect to dislocation mobility for RHEAs, or at high temperatures, at or above 600 -C. Therefore, there is a gap in available data between the room temperature yield stress and the athermal plateau stress. This makes the analysis of the low temperature regime impossible with currently available literature data.</p><p>The goal of this work is to characterize and model the yield stress of RHEAs in the low-temperature, thermally-activated regime and in the athermal plateau regime. This is done by collecting experimental data from seven single-phase BCC RHEAs and modelling the experimental yield stress with physics-based models, which are developed and applied to interpret data from this work and from the literature.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Materials and experimental methods</head><p>A total of seven alloys were produced by arc melting under an inert argon atmosphere using commercially pure elements. The produced alloys have the nominal equiatomic compositions: NbTaTi, AlNbTaTi, MoNbTaTi, WNbTaTi, HfNbTaTi, CrNbMoTi and CrMoTaTi. Following melting, all the quaternary arc-melted buttons, with the exception of AlNbTaTi, were homogenized at 1400 C under high vacuum across five 7 h individual treatments for a total of 35 h. The AlNbTaTi was not heat treated, since the precipitation of A15 phase was expected to occur upon heat treating at 1400 C; instead, it was analyzed in the as-cast condition.</p><p>Compression samples were prepared by electrical discharge machining (EDM) the homogenized arc-melted buttons initially into 6 mm thick plates with the plate normal approximately parallel to the solidification direction, followed by further sectioning these plates into cylinders 3 mm in diameter by 6 mm in length. The surfaces of the machined cylinders were ground to remove the recast layer from the cylinders. For the NbTaTi alloy, compression samples were prepared by a different procedure, i.e., the arc-melted buttons were sectioned in half, yielding a total mass of about 10 g for each half-button, and cold-rolled into rods using a total of about 10 rolling steps using special rolls ranging from a diameter of around 10 mm down to 3.6 mm; cylinders of 7.2 mm in height were cut from the rods. These cold-rolled rods were heat treated at 1330 C for a total of 4 h under vacuum before compression testing.</p><p>All quaternary alloys from this study were characterized previously, and the results are reported elsewhere <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. Besides CrMo-TaTi, all of the alloys are single-phase BCC. The CrMoTaTi alloy contains 6.2 vol % of the coarse C15 Laves phase, which was quantified by Rietveld refinement of synchrotron x-ray diffraction (XRD) data. The average C15 particle size was around 10 mm, and the particles were discontinuous.</p><p>The microstructures of the samples after processing were characterized by a combination of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), equipped with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), and XRD <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. Since the NbTaTi buttons were not homogenized at 1400 C, unlike the other alloys, the grain structure and the degree of compositional homogeneity was further assessed by a combination of nanoindentation followed by SEM-EDS performed in the same region where the nanoindentation was performed; this is shown in the Supplementary Materials section. These tests were performed on samples ground with different SiC metallographic papers down to 1200 grit, followed by polishing with 6 mm, 3 mm and 1 mm diamond media for about 5 min each. A final polishing step in 0.05 mm colloidal silica was performed for a total of 8 h in a vibratory polisher. A total of 14 nanoindentations were performed using an 8 N load, which resulted in indents of about 270 nm in depth. The indents were spaced 10 mm apart from each other. The SEM-EDS analysis was performed immediately after the indents were made to measure the compositions of the regions where each indent was made. The SEM was operated at 15 kV and the composition around each indent was measured. A pattern of EDS spectra was collected about 0.3 mm from the top, bottom, left and right of the indent, and the four spectra were quantified and averaged as an estimation of the composition where the indent was taken.</p><p>The oxygen content of the samples after all processing and machining steps was measured by the inert gas fusion infrared detection method. The total oxygen content and the compositions measured for each alloy are presented in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>. Since the starting materials were high purity and there was no source of carbon contamination, its content is negligible.</p><p>Compression tests were carried out in a Gleeble ® 3500 thermomechanical simulator. All tests were performed under a vacuum of around 10 À4 torr to mitigate oxidation and prevent increasing the oxygen content in the samples. Owing to the large number of testing conditions, only a single sample was tested at each condition. Tungsten carbide platens were used and a thin layer of Grafoil was used as a lubricant between the anvils and the samples. A heating rate of 10 C/s was used; after the samples reached the desired temperature, the sample was held for 15 s to homogenize  Compositions measured of all alloys studied in this work. The metals compositions were measured by EDS and are given in atomic percent. The oxygen content was measured by inert gas fusion infrared detection method. The nitrogen content was measured to be below 5 wt ppm for all alloys.</p><p>the temperature before starting the test. The temperature was controlled by resistive heating; the temperature was measured using a type K thermocouple spot-welded in the center of the compression samples. To evaluate if significant temperature gradients were being develop during the heating stage, one sample was heated up to 1000 C, with a second thermocouple 2 mm aside from the center of the sample A maximum temperature difference of 70 C between the two measured regions was observed with the center being hotter than the position 2 mm away (~1 mm from the WC platen). Tests were performed at a 10 À3 s À1 strain rate, up to about 30% strain in compression to ensure the sample was deformed way past the yield point. Since the samples were too small to allow any extensometer to be used, the total deformation at the end of the test was measured for each sample and the total curve was corrected based on this value. Since only the yield stress was being evaluated and not the whole flow stress curve, the observed temperature gradient did not affect the analysis since, upon yielding, the sample is still a cylinder and yielding occurs at the hottest/softest point, or the center, where the thermocouple is measuring the temperature. The yield strength was determined by the 0.2% plastic strain method.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Yield stress of the experimental alloys</head><p>The total shear stress required to move dislocations through a material (t tot ), or the critical resolved shear stress, can be described as the sum of several strength contributions as shown in Eqn. (1):</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">t tot ¼ t SS þ t GS þ t PS þ t f ðgÞ (1)</formula><p>where t SS is the solid-solution strengthening yield stress component, which is modeled in this work, t GS is the grain size dependent yield stress component typically modeled by the Hall-Petch equation _(Eqn. (2)), t PS is the precipitate or dispersion strengthening yield stress component (zero in these single phase alloys<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> ) and t f is the strain-dependent stress component that accounts for any workhardening during deformation (zero in these experiments).</p><p>For the Hall-Petch term:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">t GS ¼ k LP d À 1 2 (<label>2</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">)</formula><p>where d is the grain size and k LP is a constant, usually called the locking parameter. Since the material studied in this work with the finest grain size is the wrought NbTaTi, with an average grain size of around 400 mm (shown in the Supplementary Materials section), the grain size contribution is small; taking, for example, the average k LP constant for these three metals (430 MPa mm À1/2 ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>, the contribution of this term to the total yield stress of the material should be around 20 MPa, which is small compared to the experimentally-measured yield strengths. Therefore, the measured yield stresses in this work (s ys ) are mostly due to solid-solution strengthening, since the material is polycrystalline. The critical resolved shear stress (CRSS) must be multiplied by the Taylor factor (F t ) to be comparable to a polycrystalline yield stress, as shown in Eqn. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref>. Usually, a value of 3 is used as the Taylor factor for both FCC and BCC metals <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40]</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">s ys ¼ F t t tot ¼ F t t SS<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where F t is the Taylor factor and t tot and t SS were defined above.</p><p>There are different approaches for modeling solid-solution strengthening. One option is to derive an equation for the activation energy to move a dislocation, which allows the incorporation of the solid-solution strengthening components into this activation energy and the temperature dependence of the yield stress is intrinsically embedded in the solution. Varvenne et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref> used this approach to model the yield stress of FCC HEAs, and a good correlation between calculated and experimental yield stress was found for samples tested from low temperatures (77 K) up to temperatures above room temperature. Maresca and Curtin developed a slightly modified model <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> to that of Varvenne, which they optimized and applied to BCC materials; their model is based on the stress to move an edge dislocation. An alternative approach, such as the one pursued by Toda-Caraballo, is to develop a semi-empirical relation between yield stress and solid-solution strengthening parameters, such as atomic size and elastic modulus mismatch. By doing this, a temperatureindependent yield stress component can be derived. This model has been shown to provide accurate predictions of the yield stress of some FCC metals, especially if accurate atomic radii data are used <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. However, in order to apply this type of model for comparing different alloys, the temperature dependence of the alloys needs to be similar; while this is reasonable for FCC metals, it is not for BCC metals.</p><p>In this study, a similar methodology is developed but it is applied at a fixed temperature, in which all alloys can be compared directly. Specifically, the treatment is conducted at temperatures within the athermal plateau, where the thermal component can be ignored. As explained by Argon <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, for temperatures in the athermal plateau regime, dislocations are straight screw segments that experience the solute field as rigid lines; therefore, in this temperature range, the solid-solution strengthening effect is due to the collective effect of the solutes and average values for the atomic size and elastic modulus mismatch can be used.</p><p>The hypothesis of this work considers that the yield stress of BCC RHEAs can be modeled as a combination of two components, an athermal component, s a , which is temperature insensitive, and a thermally-activated component, s*, which has an associated activation energy and is temperature dependent. Based on this assumption, we can rewrite s ys , as given in Eqn. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">4</ref>). This type of assumption is commonly used to describe conventional BCC metals <ref type="bibr">[25,41e47]</ref>; however, it is seldom used in RHEAs. Chen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> recently applied this concept to a family of RHEAs and observed a correlation between atomic size mismatch and the athermal yield stress.</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">s ys ¼ s * þ s a<label>(4)</label></formula><p>In this study, different experimental stress-strain curves were obtained, with the goal of identifying and modeling both temperature regimes. All seven alloys were tested in compression and the respective stress-strain curves for each composition at different temperatures are provided in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>. The samples were tested from room temperature (20 C) up to 1000 C. Not all samples were tested at all temperatures; rather, the temperatures were selected to emphasize the thermal and athermal yield stress components. Therefore, more tests were performed at lower temperatures in the thermal regimes, due to the strong dependence of strength on temperature. Due to material availability, the HfNbTaTi and AlNb-TaTi alloys were only tested at 3 temperatures; however, these tests still provide valuable information for the analysis that will be presented. The yield stress data at different temperatures are presented in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>.</p><p>It should be noted that any second phases that might precipitate in these alloys are expected to have sluggish precipitation kinetics <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. Thus, given the rapid heating rates used, the yield stress measurements are taken well before any secondary phase should have formed in any of the samples. To confirm this, the samples deformed at 600 C were analyzed after deformation and no signs of the formation of any secondary phase were observed, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">S2</ref> in the Supplementary Materials section. The fact that the decrease in the yield strength is smooth, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>, further supports this. The 600 C samples were analyzed, since these samples were used to model the athermal component and, as shown later, the data from 600 C and below was used to model the thermal component.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Athermal solid-solution strengthening model</head><p>In conventional alloys, the athermal yield stress component is modeled by considering elastic distortions that a solute generates in a matrix. The nature of this distortion is believed to generate a repulsive or attractive interaction with dislocations. In order to model this effect in multicomponent alloys, Toda-Caraballo developed an athermal model. This model is described in detail in his publications <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref> and also in the Supplementary Materials section. The general idea is to adapt Eqn. ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>) to multicomponent alloys. This equation provides a typical composition dependence on yield stress valid for binary alloys.</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">Ds SS ¼ F t ZmBx n (5)</formula><p>where m is the shear modulus of the alloy and Z is a scaling constant.</p><p>The exponent n provides the composition dependence of the yield stress. For dilute solutions, the value n ¼ 1/2 can be derived <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>. In real, more-concentrated alloys, however, the most widely used value is n ¼ 2/3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>, which is known as the Labusch dependence <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>. This value accurately represents the solid-solution strengthening of several conventional alloys. While n accounts for the composition dependence, the B term accounts for the solutespecific distortion that causes the strengthening by being attractive or repulsive to dislocations. Therefore, the B term depends on the solute-solvent pair, and can be estimated using Eqn. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51]</ref>. It should be noted that the most important distortions caused by solutes have an elastic nature. The B term essentially provides an estimate of the total elastic distortion caused by the solute in the solvent.</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">B ¼ x ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi È h 0 É 2 þ fadg 2 q 4 3<label>(6)</label></formula><p>Here, the B term is being represented as a combination of an atomic size mismatch and an elastic modulus mismatch between the solute and solvent. The h' term represents the elastic modulus mismatch, while the d term is the atomic size mismatch. Both generate an attractive or repulsive interaction with dislocations.</p><p>Also, x is a constant related to the number of active slip systems in the alloy. The a term is a constant that represents the governing type of dislocations during deformation; the larger the a value, the greater the importance of edge dislocations compared to screw dislocations. This occurs, since edge dislocations will interact directly with a hydrostatic distortion field <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>; this type of field is the one typically created by alloying a solvent with larger or smaller solute atoms. Screw dislocations on the other hand, will interact indirectly, mainly through their cores <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, with this type of distortion field, since they do not possess a primary hydrostatic distortion field <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. This explains the smaller influence of this type of distortion in the case of screw dislocation mobility.</p><p>The Toda-Caraballo model is ideal for high-throughput simulations, as it is an analytical semi-empirical model that allows an estimation of the solid-solution strengthening component in a straightforward fashion. The matrix character of the model enables a simple automation of the calculations, enabling quick assessments of entire alloy systems, as will be exemplified later. The only inputs for this model are the elastic constants of each element and their atomic size. Since the focus of this work is to model the mechanical behavior of BCC materials, focus will be given for all elements from Groups 4e6 in the periodic table and aluminum (Al). Since all elements from Groups 5 and 6 (V, Nb, Ta, Cr, Mo and W) are BCC at room temperature, the elastic constants and lattice parameters of these elements in their pure metallic form are used as inputs. In order to apply the Toda-Caraballo model, these constants for the Group 4 elements (Ti, Zr and Hf) and Al must be estimated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Atomic sizes and elastic constants</head><p>The three elements from Group 4 in the periodic table have an HCP structure at low temperatures and transform into a BCC structure at high temperatures. When these materials are alloyed with elements from Groups 5 and 6, the BCC phase is stabilized. When analyzing the elastic properties of these alloys, the presence of the Group 4 elements substantially decreases the shear modulus of all elements from Groups 5 and 6 [52e54]. Experimentally, trends in the shear and bulk moduli of binary ZreNb alloys show linear decreases in the elastic constants with increasing Zr in the composition range where the BCC phase is stable <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>. Specifically, the single crystal elastic constants c11, c12 and c44 were reported, and can be converted into the polycrystalline bulk and shear moduli by Eqns. ( <ref type="formula">7</ref>) and (8) (using the Reuss equation) <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>. This is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S3</ref> in the Supplementary Materials section, where experimentally measured elastic constants of binary ZreNb alloys are plotted as a function of Zr content. Other equations, such as the Voigt equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref> can be used for the conversion; the difference between both of them is small and does not significantly impact the outcome of the calculations.</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">K ¼ c 11 þ 2c 22 3 (7) m ¼ 5c 44 ðc 11 À c 12 Þ 4c 44 þ 3ðc 11 À c 12 Þ<label>(8)</label></formula><p>The shear and bulk moduli of binary ZreNb alloys can be represented by the rule of mixtures, with the shear modulus for pure BCC Zr being 22 GPa and that for pure BCC Nb being 37 GPa. The BCC Zr shear modulus value is considerably smaller than that for pure HCP Zr, which is around 33 GPa. Similarly, the bulk modulus of pure BCC Zr is estimated to be 64 GPa. These values are for room temperature. All RHEAs from this work and most from the literature contain typically less than 50%, and no more than 75% of Group 4 elements in their composition. These alloys are in a composition range and are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S3</ref> in the Supplementary Materials section to have elastic constants well represented by the rule of mixtures.</p><p>For pure Ti and Hf, the values of 27 and 22 GPa were used for the shear moduli of the BCC structures at room temperature. These were estimated based on the first-principles study by Zheng-Hui <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>, which showed that the softening of the Nb elastic constants due to Zr and Hf additions are similar. The softening of Nb with Ti additions is less than for Zr additions; for this reason, a proportional value for the shear modulus of Ti was used. The shear modulus values calculated directly from first-principle studies was avoided in this work due to systematic errors in single crystal elastic constants that might occur when cubic crystals are simulated by density functional theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>.</p><p>The suitability of using the proposed shear modulus for Ti can be justified by comparing the predicted value for a Tie15Moe5Zr alloy with the experimental shear modulus reported <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>. In both cases, the value is 34 GPa <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>. For the Tie15Moe5Zre3Al alloy, the experimental shear modulus is 43 GPa <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>, while the calculated value is 35 GPa, meaning that Al significantly increases the shear modulus; this result is discussed later on.</p><p>For the atomic sizes of these elements, the lattice parameters of BCC Ti, Zr and Hf were determined from extrapolating the lattice parameters from several binary solid solutions between these elements with Group 5 or 6 metals using Vegard's law. For example, Ming et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref> experimentally determined the lattice constants of several TieV BCC solid solutions, by extrapolating the measured lattice constants to 0 at. % of V and a lattice parameter of 3.278 Å was estimated for pure BCC Ti. Similarly, the lattice parameters of pure BCC Zr <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref> and Hf <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref> were estimated to be, respectively, 3.563 Å and 3.539 Å.</p><p>The lattice parameter used for pure BCC Al was 3.042 Å, following the Chen et al. study <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, in which a similar calculation procedure was performed, but with multicomponent alloys instead of binaries. The shear modulus of BCC Al is discussed later.</p><p>By using these values for the atomic radii and shear moduli in the Toda-Caraballo model, sets of calculated yield stresses were obtained for each of the alloys produced experimentally in this work. The calculated values do not compare well with the experimental results, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3a</ref>, where the experimental yield stress at room temperature and 600 C is compared to the predicted values. As shown, the qualitative trend is captured by the model. The two Cr-containing alloys are predicted to be much stronger, while the ternary NbTaTi alloy is predicted to be much weaker than the actual values. However, the quantitative values are not predicted correctly where, in some cases, the experimental yield stresses are ten times higher than the calculated values. The predictions are also not accurate for the 600 C yield stress, which is in the athermal plateau region for all of the alloys (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3a</ref>). This figure includes the 7 alloys from this work, plus 4 alloys from the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">60]</ref>; the full list of alloys and the numerical stress values are given in Table <ref type="table">S1</ref> in the Supplementary Materials section. It should be noted that the calculations use the actual compositions measured and reported in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>, not the nominal values.</p><p>A similar trend is seen when the Maresca and Curtin model <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> is applied. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3c</ref>, some alloys such as the Cr containing alloys (the two with the highest strength in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>) are overpredicted by the model while other alloys, such as the NbTaTi, are significantly underpredicted. For the 600 C data, the model predicts a negative yield stress value, which could be interpreted as the barrier for deformation been totally overcome by thermal fluctuations, which can happen since in this model, all the yield strength is described as thermally activated. The two compositions <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> that were used to develop this model are well represented by the model. Details on how this model was implemented is provided in the Supplementary Materials section.</p><p>Besides the Toda-Caraballo and Maresca models, as mentioned previously, Senkov et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref> developed an alternative athermal solid solution strengthening model that was later modified by Yao <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref>. The formulation of this model is simpler compared to the previous models, but it incorporates a term for the elastic modulus mismatch. This model was also applied to the alloys from this work, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3b</ref>. The agreement between experiments and the model is comparable to the previous models, i.e., there is a good qualitative agreement, but the quantitative agreement needs improvement. Similar to the Toda-Caraballo model, the Senkov-Yao model is a semi-empirical athermal model. Since the Toda-Caraballo model was shown to successfully capture the solid solution strengthening in FCC metals <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref> and was successfully used as a tool for high-throughput alloy development <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, this model was chosen to be adapted for BCC metals. Here, the Toda-Caraballo model is modified to better represent the athermal experimental data; a similar path may be pursued to modify the Senkov-Yao model, as discussed later.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Development and application of a modified solid-solution strengthening model</head><p>As mentioned previously, the Toda-Caraballo and Maresca models model the yield stress by considering that the atomic size mismatch dominates the yield strength. The two Cr-containing alloys are predicted to be stronger than all the other alloys, due to the fact that Cr is significantly smaller than all other elements considered in this work; therefore, these alloys have the largest atomic size mismatches, resulting in the highest predicted yield stresses. The opposite is true for the NbTaTi alloy, wherein these three elements have similar atomic radii, leading to lower predicted yield stresses. The Senkov-Yao model, which incorporates elastic modulus mismatch does not have this significant overprediction for these two alloys, further suggesting the importance of the elastic modulus mismatch term. In contrast, when applied to HEAs from the CrMnFeCoNi system, the Toda-Caraballo model was shown to give accurate predictions when appropriate atomic radii were used <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. However, for the CrMnFeCoNi system, all five elements have similar shear moduli, which is not the case in the RHEAs, e.g., the shear moduli of Ti and Hf are over 5 times smaller than that of W (161 GPa). Therefore, the elastic modulus mismatch in the RHEAs is significantly more important and must be taken into account.</p><p>Based on the above discussion, it is clear that, in order to improve the Toda-Caraballo model yield stress predictions in the athermal plateau region, the elastic modulus mismatch contribution must be incorporated. Eqn. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">6</ref>) is commonly used for estimating solid-solution strengthening of binary systems and incorporates contributions from both the elastic modulus and atomic size mismatches. It is suggested here to use the same overall format for representing solid-solution strengthening in HEAs (or multicomponent alloys in general) in a matrix form, as shown in Eqns. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_8">9</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_11">10</ref>):</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">s a ¼ F t t a ¼ F t ZmM<label>(9)</label></formula><p>where The terms in Eqns. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_8">9</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_11">10</ref>) are essentially the same as defined previously (also note the full derivation of the Toda-Caraballo model in the supplementary materials section). The major difference between them and Eqn. S(7) from the Toda-Caraballo model, presented in the Supplementary Materials section, is that an elastic modulus mismatch term (h 0 j i ) is incorporated into each of the non-diagonal terms in the total elastic mismatch matrix (M). The meaning of these terms is essentially the same as the d j i terms, namely, they are related to the elastic modulus variations in the material that occur upon substituting a certain amount of the ith component by the jth component by the same amount. The diagonal terms are again zero, since they would represent substituting an element for itself, which would not generate any change in the material.</p><p>The way in which the elastic modulus mismatch is incorporated into Eqn. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> follows strictly the format given in Eqn. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>. Therefore, the two mismatch terms, d and h', can be calculated following the ideas from Eqns. S(3)e(5), but considering all possible elemental substitutions in the elastic distortion matrix M. Therefore, these terms can be estimated using Eqn. 11e13 and S8:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">d j i ¼ 1 a da j i dx j i (11) h 0 j i ¼ h j i 1 þ 0:5 h j i ¼ 1 m dm j i dx j i 1 þ 0:5 1 m dm j i dx j i (12) dm 2 1 x 2 1 ¼ 0 B B B B @ ðx 1 ; x 2 ; …; x n Þ 0 B B B B @ m 1 m 2 « m n 1 C C C C A ðx 1 À dx; x 2 þ dx; …; x n Þ 1 C C C C A 1 dx<label>(13)</label></formula><p>There are two parameters in the modified model that need to be reinterpreted, namely, (1) the relative contribution of each dislocation type, i.e., the a parameter, and (2) the scaling constant Z.</p><p>Since a relatively large dataset, including a total of 10 alloys (6 from this work plus 4 from the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">60]</ref>; the AlNbTaTi alloy was not used as described later) was used, it was possible to determine reasonable value for these 2 constants. Values of 2.6*10 À3 for Z and 12.2 for a were found to best represent the experimental data. The value of a indicates a stronger contribution from screw dislocations for BCC metals versus FCC metals (where a value of 16 was found <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>); this indicates that screw dislocations are dominant in the early stages of RHEA deformation, as they are in traditional BCC alloys. This is in agreement with the experimental observations by Couzini e et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> and Mompiou et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, who observed several straight screw dislocation segments in the early deformation stages of an RHEA and a concentrated b-Ti alloy, respectively. On the other hand, the high a value, which is closer to 16 than in traditional BCC alloys, indicates a significant contribution of edge dislocations <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. This implies that screw dislocations do not completely dominate the deformation process, consistent with the experimental observations by Dirras et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. Furthermore, the smaller value of Z is expected, since this constant is now representing data from a higher temperature.</p><p>The calculations were performed using the elastic constant values at 600 C <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref>. For the Group 5 elements, the softening profile described in the next section was applied to the room temperature data to estimate the 600 C shear modulus.

The modified equation represents the experimental data in a much more satisfactory fashion.</p><p>Although the atomic size mismatch values in these alloys is larger than those in the FCC transition metal HEAs, the elastic modulus contribution is of the same order. Since this latter contribution is also important, these alloys are predicted to be stronger than the Cr-free alloys, but not as strong as those predicted previously using the unmodified model, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3a</ref>. The NbTaTi alloy, on the other hand, has an atomic size mismatch close to zero, which before resulted in a predicted yield stress close to zero. With the modified model, a reasonable yield stress value is predicted for this alloy, since the elastic modulus mismatch is not negligible. The model developed here can be further supported by determining how well it predicts literature data <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">60]</ref>, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4b</ref>. None of the alloys shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4a</ref> and b included any of the Alcontaining alloys. Yield stress predictions for these alloys, along with alloys from the literature are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4c</ref>, where it can be seen that the predictions for these alloys are not as accurate as are the predictions for the Al-free alloys. Most likely, the reason for this difference is the nature of the bonding between Al and the refractory transition metals. Al tends to have large negative enthalpies of mixing with the refractory transition metals present in these alloys <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref>, and the resulting bonds have strong angular characteristics and are very stiff <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref>. Pure FCC Al has a relatively low shear modulus (around 25 GPa), however, the stiffness of Al atoms in these alloys is most likely much higher. As shown by Qiu et al. by DFT studies, by alloying NbVTiZr with Al, the shear modulus increases from 35 GPa for NbVTiZr to 48 GPa for NbVTiZ-rAl 1.8 , suggesting that the stiffness of Al in RHEAs is indeed high. By extrapolating this to pure BCC Al, a value of 76 GPa for the shear modulus of pure BCC Al can be estimated. Since this was predicted by DFT, it may underestimate the real value.</p><p>As mentioned previously, for the model developed here, a rule of mixtures was assumed between all the elements in solution. This is most likely a poor assumption for Al, given its unique bonding nature with the other elements, which could result in a variable stiffness depending on the elements it is bonded with. For calculating the yield stress values presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4c</ref>, a shear modulus of 95 GPa was used for Al, which is somewhat higher than the 76 GPa found by DFT. However, this was the shear modulus that best represented the experimental data. This suggests that to achieve better quantitative predictions in the Al-containing alloys, the specific interaction between Al and the other elements in solution should be described in a more accurate manner than done here. This is an interesting and complex problem that is beyond the scope of this work, which is focused on modeling solid-solution strengthening in RHEA behavior in general, rather than on a specific class of RHEAs containing non-refractory elements. Therefore, the yield stress predictions of Al-containing alloys are more unreliable and should be used for qualitative comparisons only.</p><p>It is important here to mention the potential effect that interstitial elements might have on the model developed here. Interstitials are known to have a more pronounced effect in BCC metals compared to FCC metals <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>. In BCC metals and alloys, interstitial elements affect both the athermal and the thermal yield stress components [65e67]. While their effect on the thermal component can be large, it was shown for several BCC metals <ref type="bibr">[43,65e71]</ref> that the effect on the athermal yield stress component is much smaller and usually results in a linear change in the yield stress with concentration and to always increase the athermal yield strength. This component is usually on the order of some tenths of MPa for the oxygen (O) contents measured here. For example, in V, 1700 at ppm of O was shown to increase the athermal stress by about 50 MPa <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[71]</ref>. In Nb, 900 at ppm of O increases the athermal stress by about 10 MPa <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[70]</ref>. In Ta, the increase is 30 MPa for 1040 at ppm of oxygen <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref>. These components are relevant, but their value is relatively small compared to the yield strength of the alloys observed in this work; for this reason, the effects of oxygen content were not considered in the modelling of the athermal yield strength.</p><p>One example of how the model developed here can be used as a tool for alloy development is presented in the Supplementary Materials Section.</p></div>

Thus, the approach chosen for modeling the athermal regime, which considered average values for the atomic properties, is not expected to work effectively for the thermally-activated component.</p><p>For a dislocation segment to slip, it must overcome local, shortrange obstacles requiring a total energy F, the "activation energy barrier" <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[72]</ref>, usually given in eV. This value represents the lattice resistance to slip where, for pure and conventional BCC metals, it corresponds to the double-kink nucleation and propagation energy of screw dislocations. At 0 K, all the energy for dislocation slip must be provided by mechanical work whereas, at higher temperatures, thermal energy will aid the dislocation in overcoming these shortrange barriers <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. Modeling any local deformation barrier requires the definition of the shape of this obstacle preventing the dislocation from slip <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[73]</ref>. Usually, the models for conventional BCC metals divide the behavior of the double kink into several different regimes [74e76] and, often, the activation energy changes between regimes <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[74,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">75]</ref>. A full description of the thermally-activated deformation mechanism yields accurate predictions, but several experiments are required to describe a material this way. These approaches are fundamental and are usually applied to pure metals. Here, a more practical approach is pursued. A general phenomenological activation energy barrier <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[72]</ref> is commonly used for metallic alloys, and is represented by Eqn. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>, which is known to accurately represent BCC and FCC alloys <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[77,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">78]</ref>. The advantage of using this barrier is that a simpler description for F can be obtained where, as will be shown, the experimental data is well represented by this phenomenological equation. Furthermore, this barrier can be used for screw, edges or mixed dislocations and thus it is more applicable to RHEAs.</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">DGðTÞ ¼ FðTÞ 1 À t À t a t 0 À t a p ! q ¼ FðTÞ " 1 À t Ã t Ã 0 ! p # q<label>(14)</label></formula><p>where the DG term, or activation free energy, represents the energy that must be supplied by thermal fluctuations at constant temperature and stress for the material to slip <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[72]</ref>, t is the applied shear stress, t a is the athermal critical resolved shear stress component, and t 0 is the shear stress required to move a dislocation at 0 K, t * is the thermal applied shear stress, and t 0 * is the critical resolved shear stress at 0 K. Finally, the p and q constants define the shape of the activation barrier. Values for these two constants are typically in the range 1/2 &lt; p &lt; 1 and 1 &lt; q &lt; 2 where q represents the "top" of the activation barrier and p models the "base" of the barrier <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[72]</ref>.

In this work, the constants for pure Mo are used for all of the alloys (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S4</ref>) to represent the average behavior of the refractory metals; this approximation is further discussed in the Supplementary Materials section. Since Eqn. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_18">18</ref>) involves a homologous temperature (T/T m ), it should be a valid approximation for the shear modulus softening of RHEAs.

The model used in this work satisfactorily represents the experimental data with reasonable accuracy.</p><p>Two constants are obtained for each metal or alloy by fitting Eqn. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref> to experimental data, namely, the lattice resistance at 0 K (s 0 ) and the activation energy barrier at 0 K (F 0 ) terms. These can be understood by examining the plots in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref> s 0 represents the strength at 0 K, so the higher these values, the stronger the material is at low temperatures. On the other hand, F 0 models the thermal dependence and determines the temperature at which the alloy still has a thermally-activated yield stress component such that, the higher this term, the higher the temperature at which the athermal plateau starts (T c ). At room temperature, all alloys shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref> still have a significant thermally-activated yield stress component. Both parameters impact the magnitude of the yield strength.</p><p>The metals from Group 5 in the periodic table, i.e., V, Nb and Ta, have the lowest measured activation energy barriers, of around 0.7e0.8 eV. When these metals are alloyed, the activation energy substantially increases, whereas the lattice resistance at 0 K does not change. If the Ta alloys are analyzed, since the s 0 decreases with alloying additions but F increases, pure Ta is calculated to be stronger close to 0 K, but at temperatures above 50 K or so, the thermally-activated yield stress component of the Ta alloys are higher than that for pure Ta. This phenomenon is commonly reported in the literature as solid-solution softening, and is common in BCC alloys at low temperatures <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">81,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">82]</ref>.</p><p>Mo and W, which are from Group 6 in the periodic table, have larger s 0 and F values than the metals from Group 5. W has the highest values for both; this makes pure W the strongest material among those shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref> at all temperatures. While W and Mo alloys are usually stronger, they are often brittle at room temperature <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">[83,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">84]</ref>. For this reason, the ductilities of these alloys have not been studied as much as for Nb and Ta-based alloys.</p><p>The datasets for Mo and W were modeled in the literature with more specific equations for double-kink nucleation in BCC metals [74e76]. Using these models, the estimated activation energy for double kink nucleation was 1.27 eV for Mo and 1.75 eV for W at temperatures between 220 and 600 K. At higher temperatures, multiple slip systems become active, such that, at temperatures above 350 K for Mo and 650 K for W, the yield stress drops more rapidly with increasing temperature. The activation energies found using the more fundamental models are close to the values encountered here, 1.2 and 1.81 eV, respectively. This and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref> show that the phenomenological equation used here can effectively describe the whole temperature regime. Therefore, the approach chosen, although simple, is still effective.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.">Refractory high entropy alloys</head><p>The experimental thermally-activated yield stress components of the RHEAs produced in this work are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6</ref>. The plot also includes the calculated thermally-activated yield stress components using the model developed here. Good agreement between the experimentally measured and the calculated values show that RHEAs can be effectively described by the model.</p><p>The RHEAs are shown to exhibit similar behavior to that of conventional refractory alloys. As the alloying content increases, the F 0 term keeps increasing. Pure Nb and Ta have an F 0 below 0.8 eV, whereas the ternary NbTaTi alloy has an F 0 term almost two times larger (1.54 eV). All concentrated solid solutions have significantly higher activation energy barriers with the WNbTaTi alloy with the largest value (1.89 eV) of all the alloys evaluated, including pure W, the conventional material with the highest activation energy.</p><p>When the yield stresses calculated for the conventional alloys and the RHEAs are plotted together (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref>), the effect of alloying becomes evident. Upon alloying, the activation energy of all alloys increases significantly; the increase is more than the average of the activation energies of the pure metals (e.g., compare the binary Ta-2.5 W alloy with the RHEAs). This is even more evident when only Ta-containing alloys are compared (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7a</ref>); as shown, more concentrated alloys tend to have higher a thermal contribution, where this contribution is determined to be composition specific. This increase in the The RHEAs exhibit, in most cases, a higher lattice resistance extrapolated down to 0 K compared to pure metals. For example, the MoNbTaTi alloy is predicted to be stronger than pure Mo, Nb and Ta at all temperatures. WNbTaTi, on the other hand, is stronger than Nb and Ta, but weaker than W at 0 K. No rule of mixtures analysis seems to be valid for these terms, and the high s 0 would have to be attributed to Ti, which is unlikely, since this metal in the BCC form is softer than the Group 6 and 7 metals. Likewise, no rule of mixture term appears to be valid for the F 0 term, reinforcing the complex nature of the thermally-activated deformation component. All these results reinforce the premise that local atomic configurations, rather than an average term, dictate the thermallyactivated yield stress parameters. It should be noted that the model used here might not represent the low-temperature data of RHEAs, since no experimental data below room temperature were acquired.</p><p>As noted above, interstitial elements are known to have a strong effect on the thermally-activated yield strength of BCC metals <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>. Small differences in interstitial element contents might considerably change this component <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>. Although the interstitial element contents were low, and about the same for all alloys, the same content might impact each composition differently, so the variability observed in F 0 and s 0 might be a convolution of an intrinsic  behavior of each RHEA together with the influence from these interstitial elements, in this case, most likely oxygen. Furthermore, the interstitial elements most likely have different solubilities in different RHEAs. The effect of interstitial elements in RHEAs is usually ignored and moving forward in the direction of a more fundamental understanding the dislocation motion in RHEAs at low temperatures, the effect of interstitial elements must be addressed.</p><p>By magnifying the temperature range near room temperature (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7c</ref>), it is possible to see how significant the thermally-activated contribution is to the total yield strength, especially for RHEAs. Therefore, it is not surprising that attempting to apply an athermal model to room temperature data will yield inaccurate predictions, as shown in the previous section.</p><p>By combining the thermal and athermal yield stress predictions developed in this work, the full yield-stress vs. temperature of the five RHEAs can be effectively predicted, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref>. The athermal yield strength value dictates the yield stress plateau, and this term is also present at all lower temperatures. At higher temperatures, not shown in the graph, longer-range thermally-activated mechanisms are triggered, and the yield stress again starts to drop.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusions</head><p>The yield stresses of seven RHEAs were measured at different temperatures to evaluate the solid-solution strengthening mechanisms operating in these alloys. The following conclusions can be drawn:</p><p>The yield stress of single-phase BCC RHEAs can be divided into thermally-activated and athermal components. The yield at the athermal plateau can be modeled with reasonable accuracy using the model developed in this work. It considers the dislocations interacting with collective solute effects, namely with the average atomic size and elastic modulus mismatches within the lattice. For the predictions to be accurate, atomic size and shear modulus for all elements need to be determined for the BCC crystal structure. Three factors were observed to affect the athermal yield stress of single-phase BCC RHEAs: the total shear modulus of the alloy, the atomic size mismatch, and elastic modulus mismatch of the elements in solid solution. The thermally-activated yield stress component of RHEAs can be modeled using a phenomenological barrier for the screw dislocation motion and an Arrhenius-type dependence for the strain rate dependence. The analysis shows that the yield stresses at room temperature of all RHEAs have a significant thermally-activated contribution that needs to be evaluated separately from the athermal component. The activation energy barrier (F 0 ) and the lattice resistance at 0 K (s 0 ) are higher in RHEAs in comparison to conventional alloys and pure metals; this helps to explain the high strength of RHEAs at room temperature, where they are found to have large thermal and athermal yield stress components at this temperature. F 0 and s 0 cannot be predicted by any rule of mixtures treatment of the values of the pure metals, since the thermally-activated deformation mechanisms rely on short-range interactions that are likely to deviate from average values.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .Fig. 2 .</head><label>12</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
