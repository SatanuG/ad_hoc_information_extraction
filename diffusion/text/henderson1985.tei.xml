In addition, Eu diffusion in a basaltic and an andesitic melt was determined. Diffusion of all cations follows an Arrhenius relationship, activation energy values being high for diffusion in the panteUerite melt (e.g. Eu: 100 kcal tool -i) except in the case of Na (24.3 kcal tool-i).

The range of diffusivities shows a marked change with melt composition; over two orders of magnitude for a basaltic melt, and nearly four orders for a pantellerite melt (both at 1,300 ~ C). Diffusivity of all cations (except Li and Na) correlates positively with the proportion of network modifying cations. In the case of Li and Na the correlation is negative but the diffusivity of these ions correlates positively with the proportion of Na or of Na + K ions in the bulk melt.

Li and Na diffuse by a distinct mechanism which involves exchange of similar or identical ions. The diffusion behaviour of the smaller alkali metal ions is sufficiently distinct</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>The study of element diffusion in magmas has received a marked impetus in recent years because of its relevance to several geochemical problems involving kinetic aspects (e.g. crystal growth, Soret effect in magma chambers etc.) as well as to new approaches for elucidating the general nature of silicate melt structure. In these contexts, data for diffusion in a wide range of natural melt compositions are required and we have therefore extended our previous studies of tracer diffusion <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Lowry et al. 1981 ;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Lowry et al. 1982;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Cunningham et al. 1983)</ref> to that of several cations in two anhydrous acidic melts -of pitchstone and of pantellerite compositions. We now provide sufficient data (obtained under the same experimental conditions) involving cations of different charges and sizes, as well as melts of widely differing compositions, for an investigation of the factors affecting cation tracer diffusion. Data obtained by other workers (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Hofmann and Magaritz 1977;</ref><ref type="bibr">Magaritz and Hofmann ~978b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Jambon 1982</ref>) are also used.</p><p>For magmatic systems it is important to ascertain if a change in the nature of the diffusion medium has a significant effect on the isothermal diffusion of cations. If it does, then diffusion data may provide a further means of investigating the structural nature of silicate melts. Theoretical and experimental studies of the time-averaged arrangement of atoms in a melt have centred on the so-called network forming elements (Si, A1, etc.) and their linking with oxygen atoms to form various network or other structural units. Less attention has been given to the co-ordination of network modifying cations, if often being assumed that it is octahedral, although simple considerations of the behaviour (e.g. partitioning between crystals and melt) of elements of a range of sizes and charges suggest that several types of co-ordination sites aice available. Packing models, whether theoretical or empirical, also indicate this; for example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Whittaker (1978)</ref> showed that cavities with co-ordinations of 5, 6 and 8 amongst others are probable in a random close packing of oxygen atoms. We have attempted a new approach in the study of diffusion in magmas by investigating the effect of the availability of sites suitable for cations, and of the proportion of network modifying cations on </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental Techniques</head><p>The radiotracer residual-activity method was used <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Hofmann and Magaritz 1977)</ref> under the conditions described elsewhere <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Lowry et al. 1982)</ref>. The main diffusion media inthe present study were two acidic melts (a pitchstone and a pantellerite) of similar silica content (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>); each was loaded into 1.5 mm diameter platinum tubes by capillary rise. Experiments were run in air, in vertical tube furnaces, the duration ranging from one hour to several weeks depending on the tracer used. Evidence has been presented earlier <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Lowry et al. 1982</ref>) that the method is free of error caused by convection in the melt, under the conditions used and with the relatively high viscosities of the two melts. The added radiotracers were 22NaC1, 134CSC1, 133BAC12, 6~ 54MNC12, lSZEuC12 and 59FEC13 for both melt compositions except that the diffusion of Mn and of Co were not studied in the pantellerite melt. Tracer diffusion coefficients were determined between 1,300-1,400~ in the pitchstone and between 1,20(~1,300 ~ C in the pantellerite. Additionally, Eu diffusion was measured in the andesitie and the alkali-basaltic melts that were used in earlier work <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Lowry et al. 1982</ref>). In the case of the pitchstone and andesite melts, experiments using the Eu tracer were run at temperatures as low as 1,250 ~ C, i.e. below the andesite liquidus.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>The tracer diffusion coefficients are given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>. The data were fitted to the Arrhenius relationship (1):</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">D = D O exp (--Q/R 7).</formula><p>(1)</p><p>Where D=Tracer-diffusion coefficient (crees 1); Do = Arrhenius pre-exponent (cm 2 s-1); Q=Activation energy (kcal tool-1); R = Gas constant (kcal K -a mol-1); T= Absolute temperature (K).</p><p>Figures <ref type="figure">1</ref><ref type="figure">2</ref><ref type="figure">3</ref>show that the data conform well to this relationship over the limited temperature range. The data points for Eu diffusion in the andesitic or pitchstone melts given here do not show the departure from linearity reported <ref type="bibr">(Magaritz and Hofmann 1978b)</ref> for Eu diffusion in a tholeiitic basaltic melt below about 1,310 ~ C. The calculated parameters Q and D o are presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref> with estimates of their precision (1 a). It should be noted that the regression leads to high associated errors in Do; consequently the ensuing discussion is concentrated on interpretations using relative diffusivities and activation energies. There are very few published data on tracer diffusion in natural silicate melts with which our results may be compared. <ref type="bibr">Magaritz and Hofmann (1978 a)</ref> reported parameters for Ba and Na tracer diffusion in an obsidian glass (Ba: Q=45.1 kcal mol-~, log D O = 1.42 cmz s-1; Na: Q=22.9, log D o =-1.36), which are similar to those obtained by us for the pantellerite melt. Their data <ref type="bibr">(Magaritz and Hofmann 1978b)</ref> for Eu diffusion in a basaltic melt (Q=40.6, log Do= 1.24) differ substantially from ours (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref>), although a preliminary result for Eu diffusion in an obsidian glass (Q = 59) is close to our result for the pitchstone melt. Similarly, parameters obtained by <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Jambon et al. (1978)</ref> for Cs diffusion in an anhydrous obsidian melt (Q = 50, log D o = 1.0) are close to the values recorded here for the pitchstone melt, as are data <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Jambon 1982)</ref> for Eu diffusion (Q = 69, log D o = 0.89).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Compositional and structural controls</head><p>The ensuing discussion uses the new data given here for the two acidic melts and the data published by us for two melts of basaltic and andesitic compositions <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Lowry et al. 1981</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Lowry et al. , 1982;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Cunningham et al. 1983</ref>) as summarised in Ta-bles 1 and 3. The four melts span a range of silica content from 45.9 to 69.2% (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>) thereby providing melts of differing degrees of polymerisation. Data published by other workers for a tholeiitic melt <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Hofmann and Brown 1976</ref>; Hofmann and Magaritz /977; Magaritz and Hofmann/978 b) and for an anhydrous obsidian melt <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Jambon 1982</ref>) are also used. In attempting to discern the effects of melt composition on diffusion we have investigated the control of the proportion of non-bridging oxygen atoms and of the proportion of network modifying cations on element diffusivity and activation energy. The effects of ionic radius and charge on diffusivity are also investigated. It should be noted first, however, that general composition has a significant effect on the diffusivity of divalent and trivalent ions such that with increasing silica content the diffusivities decrease. Hence the range of diffusivities (at 1,300 ~ C) shown by all the cations studied by us covers two orders of magnitude in the basalt melt but almost four orders in the pantellerite.</p><p>In several papers Mysen and his coworkers (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Mysen et al. 1981</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Mysen et al. , 1982;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Seifert et al. 1982)</ref> have suggested that the ratio of non-bridging oxygen atoms (NBO) to the number of tetrahedrally co-ordinated ions (T) is a diagnos- RECIPROCRL TEMPERRTURE = 10' (K -1) Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>. Arrhenius diagram for Eu in alkali basalt, andesite, pitchstone and pantellerite melts tic factor in studies of the physical and chemical properties of silicate melts. We have related the diffusional parameters to NBO/T. The atomic proportions for a given number of oxygen atoms are calculated from the analysis, and then used to derive NBO/T as follows: the number of tetrahedrally co-ordinated cations are summed (T) and multiplied by 4. The value of 4T is subtracted from twice the number of oxygen atoms, the result being the total number of nonbridging oxygens in the melt (NBO), which is then divided by T <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Mysen et al. 1981</ref>). The NBO/T values for the melts studied here are given in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>, and plots of diffusivity (standardised at 1,300 ~ C) or activation energy versus NBO/ T are given in Figs. <ref type="figure">4</ref> and<ref type="figure">5</ref>. The relationships of these two parameters with NBO/T are neither linear nor systematic. Data for diffusion of cations in the pantellerite melt frequently show deviations from the trends established by the data for the other melt types, but even in these, diffusivity and activation energies of diffusion do not show regular  Hence, the parameter NBO/T is not useful in accurately predicting the diffusive behaviour of elements in melts, nor does it appear to have a fundamental controlling influence on diffusion. It is necessary, therefore, to turn to other factors. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Dowty (1980)</ref> proposed that there should be a direct relationship between the anion porosity of a medium and the diffusion of species within it, but such a relationship -5 is not observed for the melts in this study <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Lowry et al. 1982)</ref>. In fact the opposite is sometimes true, and it is observed that cation diffusion is dependent on the proportion of certain cations. A plot (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">6</ref>) of log diffusivity versus 8 the sum of the network modifying cations (per 100 oxygens) c~-6 shows near-linear trends for combinations of several elements in five melt compositions (including data for Na, -J Co, Sr and Ba diffusion in a tholeiitic melt from <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Hofmann and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Brown 1976 and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Hofmann and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Magaritz 1977)</ref>. Two data points for the diffusivity (at 1,300 ~ C) of Cs (direct measurement) and Eu (calculated from experimentally determined Arrhenius equation) in a very silica-rich (SiO 2 76.9%) melt <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Jambon 1982</ref>) lie on the same trends even though the proportion of network modifying cations is very small (8.29 per 100 oxygen). Thus, over the wide range of the proportion of network modifying cations from 8.29 to 23.95 (per 100 oxygen) there is close correlation with diffusivity. This important result shows that the chemical composition of the diffusion medium has a major control on cation diffusion (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Jambon 1982)</ref>. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">6</ref> shows clearly that the changes in melt composition have opposing effects on the diffusivity of the small alkali element ions .~ Li + and Na + compared with that of other network modifying ions, including Cs +. Diffusivity increases significantly o with increase in the proportion of network modifying ca-~-q tions, except in the case of Li § and Na § The plots shown on this diagram tend to be linear unlike those shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref> (excluding the data points for the pantellerite).</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">L) w I 1 Z r b- LI- r (J Z b- LL. C~ CD C~ -J 266 -2.</formula><p>~" Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">6</ref> also shows that several data points for a sixth ; melt (the pantellerite) depart from the trends established ~-z for the other melts, but such departures cannot be explained ,~ readily. The strong departure shown by Fe 3+ can be accounted for partially by the significant probability that " much of the Fe 3 + is acting as a network former, since the -e melt is peralkaline. On the basis of 'excess' numbers of Na and K atoms over A1 atoms, the sum of the network modifying cations (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>) in the pantellerite should be reduced from 14.15 to 11.41 atoms, because 2.75 atoms of Fe 3 + are calculated to be in tetrahedral co-ordination (i.e. network forming). However, while such a treatment brings most data points for the pantellerite closer to the trends, other points (e.g. for Cs § show greater departures. In the case of Na § it is possible to establish a near linear trend for the variation in its diffusivity in five melt compositions, including the pantellerite, when D is plotted against the number of Na atoms or the sum of Na and K atoms (Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>); the diffusivity increases with increase in the number of Na + K atoms. The implications of these findings to mechanisms of diffusion are discussed below.</p><p>A study of the data in Tables <ref type="table">1</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref> shows that there are no simple relationships between the activation energy of diffusion, Q, and the proportion of network modifying cations. For example, Na has similar activation energies of diffusion in the basalt and pitchstone melts but much lower activation energies in the andesite and pantellerite melts. This difference does not correlate with the differences in melt compositions. It is perhaps noteworthy that some of the highest activation energies are for diffusion in the pantellerite melt while several of the lowest are in the pitchstone.</p><p>Figures 8 to 10 show plots of log isothermal diffusivity  <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref>, together with diffusion data for cations in a tholeiitic melt <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Hofmann and Magaritz 1977;</ref><ref type="bibr">Magaritz and Hofmann 1978b</ref>. Four regression lines are given for the four melt types basalt (+ tholeiite), andesite, pantellerite, pitchstone. A separate regression line is drawn through the diffusion data for Li § and Na § in four melt compositions It is noteworthy that crystal field energy terms do not appear to have a significant effect on diffusivities since ions such as Mn 2 § (d s) and Co 2 § (d 7) show similar diffusivities and activation energies for each melt composition. (1,300 ~ C) versus ionic radius (based, for convenience, on octahedral co-ordinatfon) for each melt composition. Lines joint the points for ions of the same charge. The figures reveal four significant conclusions: i) Diffusivities of univalent ions decrease strongly with increase in ionic radius. The variation issuch that it should be possible to predict the diffusivity of K + in each melt from the line joining the points for the other alkali ions and using the ionic radius for K + in octahedral co-ordination (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref>).</p><p>ii) Ionic radius has little or no effect on the diffusivities of divalent and trivalent ions (cf. Hofmann 1980). iii) At the same or similar ionic radius, diffusivity decreases with increase in ionic charge. iv) Isothermal diffusivities in any one melt tend to a common value with increase in ionic radius, irrespective of ionic charge. Activation energies of diffusion show a fairly uniform increase with increase in the size of univalent ions in the basalt and andesite melts, but there is no such simple relationship for divalent or trivalent ions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Compensation</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure">11</ref> shows the positive correlation between-pre-exponent (Do) values and the activation energies for diffusion of all elements studied in this work and of those studied by <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Hofmann and Magaritz (1977)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Magaritz and Hofmann (1978b)</ref>. This correlation is termed compensation <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Winchell 1969)</ref> and compensation diagrams such as Fig. <ref type="figure">11</ref> have been used by several workers (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Winchell 1969;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Jambon 1982;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Lowry et al. 1982)</ref> to help identify different kinds of diffusion behaviour. Regression lines have been calculated for elements in each melt composition except that a separate regression line is: shown for the ions Li § and Na + in the four melt compositions. The regression lines are close and virtually parallel but that for the two alkali ions is sufficiently displaced from those for the other cations to suggest different mechanisms of diffusion. The possibility of a distinct diffusion mechanism for Na + in several silicate glasses and melts was recognized on the basis of compensation, by <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Lowry et al. (1982)</ref>. The Compensation diagram thus reinforces the distinctive nature of Na + and Li § diffusion as revealed by other parameters (e.g. see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">6</ref>). The compensation diagram does not show any possible effect of melt composition on the diffusion mechanism of the small alkali ions, suggesting that factors such as the degree of melt polymerisation are not important in their case. Although the regression lines for the four melt compositions are close they are perhaps sufficiently distinct (especially between basalt and pitchstone melts) to prevent the rejection of melt polymerisation as a causal factor.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mechanisms</head><p>The determination of diffusivities, and of the Arrhenius parameters Q and D O for elements in natural melts not only provides empirical data which may be applied directly to problems involving geochemical kinetics but also helps to establish a base for the construction of a coherent theory relating to the physical and chemical properties of silicate melts. The former objective has applicability in several aspects of element mobility including those of crystal growth and of volatile element loss from magmatic bodies. The wide range in diffusion coefficients (e.g. over nearly four orders of magnitude in a pantellerite melt at 1,300 ~ C) and their relatively low values mean that diffusion can in some geological processes be a determining factor in the degree of geochemical fractionation of different elements. The latter objective, through its more fundamental nature, should enable a greater and more accurate degree of prediction to enter the study of melt properties. In this context it seems important that consideration is given to possible mechanisms of tracer diffusion.</p><p>Let ions X and Y, not necessarily of the same charge, be in a melt containing cation sites of types i, j ..... etc. some of which are filled (e.g. Xi) and some of which are vacant (symbol El). Diffusion of X, Y and other ions could be by any of the following mechanisms, with respect to diffusion of X, initially in an i site.</p><p>(i) Exchange mechanism (E-type)</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">E.1 x, ~-x, E.2 x, ~-xj E.4 X,~-Fj</formula><p>This E-type mechanism is equivalent to the exchange mechanism for volume diffusion in crystals. In the case of a labelled tracer, mechanism E.1 can lead to the apparent diffusion of X a particular direction.</p><p>(ii) Vacancy mechanism (V-type)</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">V.I Xi~-Ell V.2 Xi ~ Di</formula><p>The V-type is equivalent to the vacancy mechanism in crystals and also to the interstitial mechanism, since for the melt we are not able to define a constant, repeatable unit of basic structure as in a crystal.</p><p>(iii) Displacement mechanism (D-type)</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">D.I Xi ~---Yi "-~ Di i.e. initial state: X i Yi%; final state: DiXiY v</formula><p>This type of mechanism strictly does not consist of two V-type steps, i.e. Xi Yi t:Ii ---&gt; Xi rai Yi --&gt; Di Xi Y i because the activation energy of the D-type mechanism will not be the same as either of the V-type steps or a simple addition of them. D.2-D.8. As above but for different combinations of X, Y and sites i and j, for X initially in an i-type site. The D-type mechanism could be considered as being approximately equivalent to an interstitialcy mechanism for volume diffusion in crystals although it may not be possible to define an interstitial position (or an interstitialcy) in a melt, as is possible for a crystal.</p><p>The above mechanisms treat the diffusion of X as being relative not only to some general reference point but also to an immobile set of atoms (or ions) disposed so as to provide definable sites. A further mechanism (or mechanisms) can be envisaged in which the cation site is itself subject to some kind of movement with the cation taken along with it (site-movement, S-type). The distinction of this mechanism from the others is at least twofold: firstly only one site need be involved, and secondly it involves an energy change for the overall process affecting the disposition of the surrounding atoms and the location of Jr. Any process involving site changes but with X remaining in the same location with respect to the general reference point (e.g. X i changing to Xj through change in the disposition of surrounding atoms) is not considered as a mechanism for the diffusion of X.</p><p>In order to assess the likely contribution from each of these mechanisms to the overall diffusion of X, it is helpful to consider the likely availability of sites for network modifying cations and the number of vacancies. In a cubic close packing of anions (e.g. oxygens) there are 300 available polyhedral interstices (200 tetrahedral and 100 octahedral) per 100 anions. Applying the data from Table <ref type="table">1</ref> to this simple model approximately47 (16%) of interstices will be filled by network forming cations and no more than about another 24 (8%) occupied by network modifying cations, leaving a minimum of about 230 (76%) vacant cavities. There is a similar number of polyhedral interstices in a random close packing of spheres (anions) as in a cubic close packed one, although there are many more types of polyhedra <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Whittaker 1978)</ref>. Not all the vacancies will be suitable for occupancy by cations but it is clear that there are several vacant cavities (up to 1 I) per network modifying cation. Although such anion packing models may not be strictly applicable to silicate melts, they serve to show that vacant cavities are likely to be a significant feature of melt ' structure'.</p><p>Availability of vacant cavities do not, however, appear to be the most important control on diffusion since diffusivities of the network modifying cations, except those of Na + and Li +, increase with increase in the proportion of such cations, and those of Na + and Li + increase with increase in the proportion of Na + ions (and of Na + +K+). Thus, a V-type mechanism does not seem to be the dominant one for most cations. This dependence of diffusivity on cation numbers (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">6</ref>) suggests that an exchange mechanism, or E-type, operates. This could allow local charge balance to be preserved -a factor which would be of great importance in systems in which adjustments to the charge distribution in the anionic framework are likely to be relatively slow. The fact that sodium (and lithium) diffusion is positively correlated with the number of Na + ions, and negatively with the number of network modifying cations indicates that mechanisms E.1 and/or E.2 are dominant (but see below). The other network modifying cations are not constrained by the number of their own species but by the total number of network modifying cations. Thus, in these cases mechanisms E.3 and E.4 appear to be the more important. A distinction in the mechanism of diffusion for Na + and Li + compared to that for the other cations is indicated by the compensation plot (Fig. <ref type="figure">11</ref>), as discussed above.</p><p>Site availability in terms of the distribution of specific polyhedra, especially those suitable for occupancy by large cations, must have some control, for otherwise Cs + (and K + by prediction) would be expected to show similar behaviour to Na + and Li + (cf. Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">6</ref> and<ref type="figure">7</ref>). The high activation energy for Cs + diffusion, in relation to those for Na + and Li + (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref>), must stem from the large size of this ion, which in turn could lead to a different mechanism for diffusion. (Polyhedra with large co-ordination numbers, namely, dodecahedra and trigonal heptatopes, suitable for occupancy by large cations such as Cs +, comprise only 2.4% of the available cavities in a random close packed structure, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Whittaker 1978)</ref>.</p><p>Exchange of neighbouring ions is considered to be an unlikely mechanism for diffusion in crystals because it involves a large distortion in the local structure, but such a constraint need not operate in the case of silicate melts at high temperature. If it does still operate then two V-type reactions with the same overall result as one E-type reaction could occur but would be indistinguishable from the E-type except by differences in the activation energy. There are insufficient data to investigate this relationship adequately but it is interesting to note that the activation energy for Ba 2+ is significantly lower than those for most other divalent ions in all melt compositions, despite the large size of this ion. Thus Ba 2 + diffusion could be by a double Vtype mechanism whereas diffusion for the other ions would be by an E-type. Similar reasoning could be applied to the diffusion of Sr 2 + in the andesite melt (low activation energy, V-type) relative to that in the basalt melt (high activation energy, E-type). The relatively low activation energies for Li + and Na + diffusion in all melts (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref>) could also be a result of diffusion by a vacancy mechanism, rather than by an exchange mechanism (which would require a high activation energy) as suggested above. Until there is more evidence on the relationships between alkali element diffusion and proportions of certain network modifying cations (e.g. see Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>) it will not be possible to establish which of the two mechanisms operates.</p><p>Little can be said of the D-type and S-type mechanisms from the available data, except that if they were dominant modes of diffusion, a greater uniformity in activation energies and diffusivities would be expected than is observed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discus~on</head><p>Although there are large differences in diffusivities, they are in general related in a sufficiently ordered way to compositional or structural parameters (e.g. proportion of network modifying cations in a melt, ionic radius etc.) to allow predictions of the order of diffusivity of any network modifying cation of known charge in a melt. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Jambon (1982)</ref> and I-Iofmann (1980) drew attention to the good correlation between diffusivities of the alkali metal ions and ionic radius, but the data given here show that diffusivities of divalent and trivalent ions are rather uniform (for a particular valency) and that it is necessary to know the valency of an ion before its diffusivity can be estimated from diagrams such as those in Figs. <ref type="figure">8</ref><ref type="figure">9</ref><ref type="figure">10</ref>.</p><p>The interpretation of the diffusion data has centred on the model of ionic diffusion without any direct evidence that cations exist as discrete entities in these melts. There is, however, a substantial body of published data in support of the model for magmas although there have been sugges-tions that metal-oxygen complexes can exist <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Nelson and White, 1980)</ref>. Our data for the divalent and trivalent metals are not inconsistent with diffusion of these elements as complexes or molecular entities, especially since the diffusivities are independent of ionic radius (Figs. 8-10) and the activation energies for diffusion are high. It is interesting to note that <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Dunn (1982)</ref> in a study of oxygen diffusion in some synthetic silicate melts showed that the range of diffusivities encompassed the range of divalent cation diffusivities in silicate melts. He speculated that oxygen diffusion "may involve a contribution from a cation-like diffusion mechanism as well as contributions from the diffusion of large structural units in the melt". Alternatively some oxygen may be forming molecular entities with some 'network modifying' elements. Some evidence for the existence of molecular entities and quasi-molecular complexes involving transition metals in silicate glasses has been provided from work using optical and vibrational spectroscopic techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Nelson et al., 1983)</ref>, although free ions also occur. The difference in the diffusion behaviour of Na and Li from the other cations could be explained, therefore, as arising from the occurrence of Na and Li predominantly as free ions while the other elements occur predominantly as molecular entities and/or as quasi-molecular complexes.</p><p>Data for the pantellerite melt are anomalous for many of the relationships investigated here, but the reasons for this are not apparent. This melt has behaved in other anomalous ways. For example, during the preparation of the experimental charges it appeared to have the highest viscosity of all the four melts despite the high content of alkali elements and the similarity in its value of NBO/T to that of the andesite. The possibility that some of the iron in this melt is in four-fold coordination (i.e. network forming) reduces the anomalous behaviour of the diffusion of trivalent ions in terms of diffusivity as a function of the proportion of network modifying cations. Evidence is now forthcoming (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Binsted et al. 1984</ref>) that a larger proportion of the ferric ions could be in four-fold coordination than is required to compensate for the excess of alkali atoms over aluminium. If this is the case in the pantellerite melt studied here then it would provide an explanation for the deviation of the divalent and trivalent ions (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">6</ref>). Therefore, diffusion data can possibly provide some insight into site occupancies by 'cations' in peralkaline melts.</p><p>The results presented here and by other workers (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Hofmann and Magaritz 1977;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Jambon 1982</ref>) are of geological significance by virtue of the large range of diffusivities shown by different ions in the same melt (e.g. a range of over three orders of magnitude shown by ions in a pitchstone melt at 1,300 ~ C, Fig. <ref type="figure">10</ref>). These differences in diffusivities could be an important contributing factor to element fractionation in geological processes involving magmas. One such process could be the transport of elements across a magma-solid interface such as seen in the case of some igneous intrusions and country rock. The rate at which cations move through and out of the magma body could be related directly to their diffusivities in the magma. This process would, on the basis of diffusivities, tend to fractionate the alkali metals Li, Na and K from the majority of other elements. Under appropriate conditions, Li would be able to leave the magma at a faster rate than Na which in turn would be faster than K. It is also clear that the diffusivity values are of use in quantifying rates of mineral growth in magmas if these are diffusion controlled.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>In the light of a synthesis of new and previously published data, the diffusion of several cations in natural silicate melts is now shown to be dependent on the proportion of network modifying cations. Diffusivities for all cations studied (except Li + and Na +) increase with increase in the proportion of network modifying cations. For Li + and Na + they decrease. However, the diffusivity of Na + is shown to correlate positively with the proportion of Na atoms in the melt. Ionic charge has a significant effect on a cation's diffusivity, but ionic radius is of little importance except in the case of the alkali metal ions.</p><p>The diffusion data plot systematically on a compensation diagram but the data for Na + and Li + define a distinct trend, separate from trends for the other data. This evidence, together with the correlations relating to network modifying cations has enabled mechanisms of diffusion in magmas to be proposed. Most cations diffuse by an exchange mechanism which preserves local charge balance, but the mechanism for Na + appears to involve exchange with similar or identical ions to itself. Alternatively the diffusion of Na + and of Li + could, on the basis of their relatively low activation energies, involve a vacancy mechanism. Thus, the investigation of the controls of diffusion has given insight into the nature of silicate melts especially with respect to the significance of the availabilities of cation sites and of network modifying cations. Diffusion data for a pantellerite melt, however, do not always follow the relationships observed for other melts, showing that more work is needed on the properties of melts of widely differing compositions.</p><p>Relative diffusivity can be an important factor in fractionating the chemical elements one from the other during certain geological processes, and could play a role in the transport of alkali metals out of an igneous melt.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 6 .</head><label>6</label><figDesc>Fig. 5.
