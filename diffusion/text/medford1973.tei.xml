Since then an extensive investigation of viscosity has been effected <ref type="bibr">(Shaw 1965a</ref><ref type="bibr">(Shaw , 1969, in press;, in press;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Shaw et a/. 1968;</ref><ref type="bibr">Bottinga and Weill B 970, 1972)</ref>. The electron microprobe provides a c o m n i c n t means of analyzing dif-Eusion gradients (Yoder 1970-7 1 ) and is used lnere to determine the diffusion coefficient of calcium in a natural mugearita: melt at different temperattnrcs. The activation energy of the process is then deduced.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Previous Work</head><p>The geological literature includes several publications concerned with diffusion, which are mostly qualitative discussions of its role and importance in geological processes. Interest was aroused in the late 19th century by proponents of the Soret effect (for a summary ,we WahB 1946, Eitel 89541, but its importance remained qnestionable. The ensuing controversy prompted <ref type="bibr">Bowen (1928 )</ref> to undertake the first experirncnt;il work in geology, from which he obtained estimates of the diffusion rates of the elements of diopside and plagisclase in the liquid state. From his experiments he concluded that diff~asion caused by the Soret effect is too slow to account for any appreciable concentration gradients before complete solidification of most igneous bodies.</p><p>In 1946, UTahl suggested that diEerentiation by thermodiffusion (Soret effect plus convection) is important and citcd several examples, including Mount Johnsois with its ptrlaskiteessexite association (see also Philpotts 1968). Bnrth <ref type="bibr">(1952)</ref> supported his views and argucd in favor s f the process, although .no kinetic data were available to prove or disprove its importance.</p><p>Shaw (1 965b) reported some first results of rates of diflfusion of H 2 0 in granitic melts, which showed that, under static conditions, hydration or dehydration of magma charnbers is exceedingly slow. However, he also concludecl that in conjunction with convection diffusion could be geoiogically significant within granitic magma ctaan~bers QShaw 1965a, p. 149). <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Oppenheim (1968)</ref>, to test the possible effects of clectricaB currents within the earth, has performed experiments in which differentiation is achieved by electrolysis of a molten basalt, and some Soviet workcrs have rcvived interest in the Soret effect QScheinmann 1969) and are apparently working on diffusion, although nothing has been p~mblished to the author's knowledge.</p><p>----Experimental Procedure ried diffusion couple was constructed with the lower portion enriched with calcium. Enough CaO was added to allow detection by the electron microprobe, and the formation of an easily measured diffusion curve. At the same time, to minimize any concentration dependence of the diffusion coefficient, the composition difference was kept as small as possible. The diffusion couple was held in a platinum crucible with a 0.508-cm outside diameter and 0.038-cm walls, formed by crimping one end of a tube shut and welding it. The crucible was about 2.3 cm long, thus allowing each half of the diffusion couple to occupy about 1 cm of constant diameter cross-section. The wall thickness was greater than that absolutely necessary, but served to help equalize any temperature gradients along the sample length. The calciumenriched material was calculated to be denser than the natural melt (Bottinga and Weill 1970) and so was placed in the bottom half of the crucible to inhibit convection.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample Preparation</head><p>The starting material was a fine-grained dike rock, which was crushed and fused in a 50-ml alulnina crucible in air for 3 hours at 1350 "C to allow for the degassing of water and other volatiles. The melt from the uncontaminated central portion of the crucible was crushed and ground in a mechanical agate mortar for 40 min to allow further mixing. A split of this powder was then combined with CaO powder to bring the melt composition up to about 10 wt. % CaO, and this portion was ground for another 40 mill to obtain adequate mixing. Both the natural and the calcium-enriched split were subsequently fused for 4 hours at 1420 OC. The former was crushed to 50 mesh or finer and the latter reground for another 40 min.</p><p>A small quantity of Ca-enriched powder was added to the run crucible and fused long enough to allow bubbles to escape (about 10 min) . The procedure was repeated until the crucible was half filled. This prevented the formation of large bubbles stretching right across the crucible, which would never rise to the surface. The filling was done at 1420 "C, as the melt was sutficiently inviscid at this temperature to allow rapid degassing. The charge was then left for about 20 hours to allow homogenization, after which it was quickly withdrawn from the furnace, and a tool steel rod forced down the crucible to flatten the meniscus. Material that had coated the upper half of the crucibIe was removed with a flat-ended drillrod and a fine silica carbide abrasive. This also formed a flat interface on the glass surface.</p><p>The natural melt had to be added quickly to prevent unwanted diffusion. At the same time, bubble formation had to be avoided. This was achieved by filling the remainder of the crucible with the relatively coarse powder (except at the interface, where a fine dusting of powder was used to form a flat surface) and fusing for 15-20 s at 1420 "C. Because of compaction upon melting, this had to be repeated two or three times, but the aggregate loading time formed an insignificant portion of the total run times and the correction required was negligible.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis of the Starting Material</head><p>The rock was collected from a dike on the eastern side of Mount Royal, Quebec, Canada, and the fused material has the bulk and normative compositions given in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>. These correspond closely to the mugearites described by Muir and Tilley (1961 ). The analysis recalculated to 100% is used as the natural glass analysis, and the composition of the calciumenriched glass is also shown. The rock is texturally similar to photomicrograph B in Muir and Tilley (1 961 ) and consists of about 60% feldspar (.l mm), 25% green altered pyroxene or amphibole (.I mm) sometimes preserved as aligned oxide minerals, 10% calcite occurring as small patches throughout the matrix, and 5 % oxides. Scattered phenocrysts of plagioclase (.5 mm) with replaced cores of muscovite and minor scapolite are also present.</p><p>To check for iron loss to the crucible, and alkali loss that might occur during prolonged heating, small samples of the natural melt were heated for various lengths of time in open platinum crucibles at 1420 O C . The results (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>) indicate insignificant loss compared with the analytical variation of the analyses. The oxidation state of iron was not controlled. The FeO content was found to have changed from 5.44 to 1.9'7% in a sample fused for 20 h at 1420 "C, and to 2.32 and 2.09 in Can. J. Earth Sci.

The temperature was monitored continuously, using a digital voltmeter, and was kept at f 2.0 "C for the duration of the experiment by adjusting a variac which controlled the external power supply. The run temperature was attained within about 2 min of lowering the crucible couniing for the effect of concentration gradient j on flux Ji.

In this work the composition differences, apart from calcium, were so small (see Table <ref type="table">1</ref>) that no other gradients could be detectcd.

In these experiments the The sample was ground along its length to half its thickness and polished to a degree suitable for microprobe analysis. Ten-second counts were taken on a central line along the length of the sample at intervals of 0.05 cm, and in somc cases 0.025 cm.</p><p>To evaluate the curve, one is interested in obtaining the composition of points relative to each other. If thc microprobe was completely stable (no drift, etc.) one could simply analyze each position in turn, with as many 10-s counts as required to gain the required statistical precision. This is not the casc, however, and so the following procedure, utilizing a blocking and randomization scheme <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Cochran and Cox 1957)</ref>, was used to gain the required internal coiasistency. A block was taken to be composed of one 10-s count at each of the positions along thc lcngth of the sample. The order of the positions analyzed was then randomized within each block, and as many blocks as desired were completec%. The analysis of each block was performed as quickly as possible. Thus any drift components are incorporated in the variance of the estimatc of each position. As long as there was no significant change in operating level of the microprobe from block to block, the mean of all the readings at any position could be taken as the concentration of that position. Confidence limits for the mean based on p readings are (95 % coi~fidence limit) where F (.r) is the mean of the readings at position X , and 9 is an estimate of the standard deviation of the p readings (Freund 1962, p. 230). Changcs in the operating level of the microprobe could be detected by summing all the readings within a block. Those blocks whose means varied significantly could be discarded or a suitable correction factor applied. Up to 32 readings were taken at each position, but 12 to 14 were ultimately found to be sufficient. In general. the precision required and hcnce thc valuc selected for p would depend an the overall difference in counts between range was about' 300 counts a n d the precision with y set at 14 was 2 2 0 counts, with 95% confidence limits, that is, -+6.7% of the total range. The curve in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> was obtained with 14 analyses per position.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Computed Diffusion Coefficients and</head><p>Astivation Energv The results using the two methods of evaluation are presented in Table <ref type="table">4</ref>. The variation of the diffusion coefficient with temperature, Tm0 absolute, can be expressed as an activated process where Q is the activation energy of diffusion, R the gas constant, and A a pre-exponential constant. Hence changing Eq. [1 33 to one can evaluate Q from the slope of the line of a LogloD versus 1/Tm plot (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>). The value obtained by least squares is 29.5 kcal/mole, -C 3.9 kcal/mole at the 5 % level of significance, and the pre-exponential A is 2.04 x 10-"m2/s. The errors involved using the method of Eq. [$I have been extensively discussed by <ref type="bibr">Rhines and Mehl ( 1 948)</ref> and are essentially dependent on the judgment of the operat&amp; when integrating and determining slopes. The chief source of error in these experiments is that a statistical variation in the points requires IP subjective fit to be made to obtain the diffusion curve. Thus interpretational differences, especially near the end points, cause some variation in the integrated areas. This effect is minimized by ensuring that the curve is not For personal use only. <ref type="bibr">McCallum and Barrett (1952)</ref> for slags containing 37.5, 32.5, and 27.5% CaO are given by lines 1, 2, and 3 respectively.

The slope, dx/dc, on the other hand, can be estimated quite accurately at the midrange composition where the curve undergoes an inflection. In view of the above, it is felt that the coeficients lie within about 15% of the stated value. Correspondingly the activation energy is between about 22 and 34 kcal/mole. The estimates using the method of Eq. [ 5 ] arc scattered on both sides of the other results, but with one exception lie within the stated limits of error. Although the departure of the curves from the form of Eq. [ 5 ] was found to be small (Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> and<ref type="figure">2</ref>) or indeterminate, the rcsults are considered less reliable because of the exteilsion of the probability paper near the edges.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Calcium diffusion in Ca0-A120s-Si02 melts of varying proportions was followed by <ref type="bibr">McCallum and Barrett (1952)</ref> using a 5 % CaO difference, and their results are plotted in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>. The activation energy at 27.5% CaO was determined to be 28 kcal/mole, which is remarkably close to that in the present work, although their coefficients arc about one order of magnitude higher. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Towers et al. (1953)</ref>, using radioactive calcium, determined its coefficients in a slag of 40% S O n , 39% CaO, and 21 96 AI,03. The data showed considerable spread, but were similar to those obtained by <ref type="bibr">McCallum and Barrctt (1952)</ref> for the slag containing 37.5 % CaO. The activation energy, however, was 70 kcal/mole. A decrease in the diffusion rates for decreasing CaO content is suggested, although this observation may be fortuitous, as the mugearite is compositionally quite different from the slags.</p><p>To maintain electrical neutrality, either cations plus anions must migrate together (anion-controlled diffusion), or the cations must migrate separately (cation-controlled diffusion), with some other sort of charge compensating mechanism being operative. In the former case, the activation energy might be expected to be closer to that required for viscous flow. This activation energy was determined by <ref type="bibr">McCallum and Barrett ( 1952)</ref> to be about 46 kcal, and hence they proposed that the rate-controlling step was the jump of a cation from one equilibrium position to another. Their explanation of the charge compensation is not clear and they, themselves, point out that the mechanism is lrard to visualize. The results of this work are consistent with this division into anion-and cation-controlled processes. <ref type="bibr">Euler and Winkler (1957)</ref> demonstrated that melts with (Si + A1)/0 ratios between .40 and .47 consistently display activation energies for flow of 50 to 60 kcal/mole, and hence one would expect this rock, with a ratio of .43, to have a value somewhere in that range. Consequently the 29.5 kcal/mole estimate obtained here would tend to support a Ca+ + cation-controlled process.</p><p>The variation in concentration of the other elements due to calcium diffusion was unfortunately impossible to record. Presumably it is through cross-diffusion, because of activity gradients of all the species, that the chemical potential of each component in the melt is equalized, and electrical neutrality preserved. As far as the present procedure is concerned, one can only hope to evaluate the diffusion rates of all the elements separately, although the possibility of examining element interactions exists (Yoder 1970-7 1 ) .</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>TheoryL-31 Given an n-component system in which each species, i, is diffusing because of n concentra-if D is constant over the concentration range Can.
