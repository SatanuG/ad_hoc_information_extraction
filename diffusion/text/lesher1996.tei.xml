<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Self diffusion coefficients (D*) for silicon and oxygen in anhydrous basaltic liquid [O/(Si + AI) = 2.5] were measured at 1 and 2 GPa and temperatures between 1320 and 1600°C. Simple diffusion couples were composed of isotopically normal basaltic glass synthesized from chemical reagents mated to chemically identical glass enriched in '80 and 3°Si. Concentrations of '80 and 3°Si across the interfacial region of the couples were analyzed by ion microprobe. At 1 and 2 GPa, Do* is consistently larger than D*~ for a given diffusion couple, but only at the highest temperature (1600°C) is the difference outside the small uncertainties for the analytical measurements. At 1 GPa the self diffusivities for both Si and O are well-described by the Arrhenius relationship</p><p>where T is temperature in K, R is the gas constant in J K-' mole ~, and D* is expressed in m z s ~. Self diffusion coefficients at 2 GPa are a factor of 1.5 greater and at 1400°C the activation volume (V,) is -6.7 cm 3 mo1-1. The similarity in self diffusion coefficients, small activation energies (&lt;50% of the Si-O bonding energy), and negative activation volumes for Si and O self-diffusion in basaltic liquid suggest that network former diffusion is a largely cooperative process involving local contraction of the anionic structure. An evaluation of the Eyring rl-D relationship implies a mean translation distance for network former diffusion that is 2-3 times the diameter of the oxygen ion and of the order of the Si-Si separation distance. These features of network former diffusion are consistent with the formation of high-coordinated Si as a transition complex in melts populated by Q2, Q3, and Q4 species. In light of inferred changes in melt structure with increasing silica content, we further speculate that the dominant mode of network former diffusion changes from a cooperative process in basaltic liquid, perhaps involving Sits transition complexes, to an ionic process (Si n+ and O 2 ) in liquids approaching full polymerization.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>The kinetic, transport, and thermodynamic properties of silicate liquids control the generation and evolution of magmas and are intimately linked by the structure of these complex polymeric solutions. Specifically, interactions between network-forming ingredients, such as 0 2-and Si 4+, play fundamental roles in diffusive and viscous flow processes. Unlike crystalline silicates, the structure of melts is short-range and dynamic. Most spectroscopic techniques allow for averaging of the local structure on timescales comparable to lattice vibrations, and reveal similarities between crystalline and molten silicates in terms of interatomic distances and bond angles (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Hawthorne, 1988)</ref>. However, these techniques provide little information on longer timescale interactions involving the breaking and reforming of chemical bonds that are responsible for diffusive transport and viscous flow. Traditionally, these atomic motions have been studied through direct laboratory measurements of diffusion and viscosity and applications of theories that link these properties (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Oishi et al., 1975;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Shimizu and Kushiro, 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Dunn, 1982;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Lesher and Walker, 1991 )</ref>. More recent structural relaxation studies using a variety of techniques (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Brawer, 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Liu et al., 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Farnan and Stebbins, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Dingwell and Webb, 1990)</ref> have also provided important information about atomic motions in melts and glasses.</p><p>A main focus of laboratory and theoretical studies of diffusion has been to describe the configurations of activation 405 complexes. Applications of the Eyring relation have led a number of workers to conclude that oxygen diffuses as the 0 2 anion in a range of silicate melt compositions <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Oishi et al., 1975;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Yinnon and Cooper, 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Shimizu and Kushiro, 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Rubie et al., 1993)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Dunn (1982)</ref> characterized self diffusion of oxygen in melts of the diopside-anorthite join and concluded that while diffusion of discrete O 2 anions is an important mode of oxygen transport, some solutions to the Eyring relation require that the mean atomic jump distances be larger than the oxygen anion and roughly the size of the (Sit4) 4-monomer.</p><p>The conjecture that Si and O may be associated during diffusive motion was originally made by <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Towers and Chipman (1957)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Henderson et al. (1961)</ref> studying self diffusion in Ca-aluminosilicate slags, but the size or configuration of the diffusion units was not constrained. This view has been strengthened by molecular dynamic (MD) simulations <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Angell et al., 1982</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Angell et al., , 1988;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Kubicki and Lasaga, 1988)</ref> and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies of alkali silicate liquids <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Liu et al., 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Farnan and Stebbins, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Stebbins et al., 1992)</ref>. Central to these studies has been the recognition that, while Si is mainly coordinated by four oxygen (14]Si) at ambient pressure in melts, fivefold-and sixfold-coordinated species, as found for crystalline silicates, do occur and even dominate as stable configurations at high pressure. These studies also show that the concentration of high-coordinated Si depends on the degree of polymerization or cross linkage of the Sit4 tetrabedra. Contrasting models of Si and O dif-fusion, ionic vs. cooperative, result in part from the use of different probes of the activated complex; laboratory studies have relied primarily on the study of oxygen self diffusion, while MD simulations and NMR studies have examined both O and Si. Differences in existing diffusion models can be explained by the simultaneous determination of network former mobilities in the laboratory.</p><p>In this study, we present new self diffusion measurements for Si and O obtained from diffusion couples of basaltic liquid. Direct comparison of the intrinsic mobilities of the principle network constituents is possible with these experiments. The results show that the difference between D* and Ds* is negligible for basalt. We discuss these results in the context of network transport models and conclude that the dominant diffusion mode of network formers is a largely cooperative process in partially polymerized melt (basalt). We further consider the relevance of these findings for viscous flow models, implications for estimating viscosity and diffusivities from the Eyring relation, and the effects of bulk composition.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE</head><p>Starting materials for this study were prepared from chemical reagents (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). Basalt enriched in 3°Si and ~sO was synthesized using 3°Si-enriched Sit2 (Oak Ridge National Laboratory) and 'sOenriched CaCO3 was precipitated from a Ca(OH)z solution that was purged with N2 and aerated with '8t-enriched CO2 (Cambridge Isotope Lab, lnc). Isotopically normal endmembers were prepared directly from reagents obtained from Fisher Scientific, Inc. Oxide-carbonate mixtures were thoroughly blended and fused at 1400°C and 1 atm in a N2 stream and reground to &lt;30 #m powders a minimum of three times before being stored with a desiccant.</p><p>Diffusion couples were assembled by firmly packing the enriched and denser endmember composition into the lower half of the cylindrical cavity ( 1 mm I.D. × 3 mm long) of a graphite capsule with the remaining cavity filled with isotopically normal glass. This arrangement was adopted as a precaution against convection. Experiments were conducted with a standard '/2" <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Boyd and England (1960)</ref> piston-cylinder apparatus. Sample assemblies include a ~/4" I.D. graphite heater with internal rods of semi-sintered MgO surrounded by a pressure medium of BaCO3 (see <ref type="bibr">Lesher, 1994, for experimental details)</ref>. Assemblies were pressurized cold using the "piston-in" procedure. Temperature was raised at 300 degrees per min to the desired run temperature using a programmable controller.</p><p>Each diffusion couple was held isothermally for a prescribed time ranging from 20-60 min at the desired pressure. Charges were quenched to glass within seconds of shutting off the primary voltage, while advancing the piston to maintain constant pressure. Complete assemblies were extracted from the pressure vessel, impregnated with epoxy, and sectioned longitudinally to expose the charge for polishing and examination.</p><p>Chemical and isotopic gradients developed within the interfacial region of each couple were checked for chemical homogeneity using the Cameca SX-50 electron microprobe at the University of California, Davis. The silicon and oxygen isotope gradients were determined with the Cameca IMS 3f ion microprobe located at Center for Solid State Sciences, Arizona State University. lon microprobe analyses were performed using a primary ion beam of 133Cs + accelerated to + 10 keV and focused to a spot ranging from 10-20/~m in diameter. The sample potential was -4150 V, making the primary ion impact energy ~ 14.2 keV. Sample charging was controlled by delivering electrons to the sample with an auxiliary electron gun held at -7.5 keV (electron impact energy ~ 3.3 keV). The energy bandpass was set to accept secondary ions with energies of 4500 _+ 20 eV, so that only those ions ejected from the sample with excess kinetic energies of 350 _+ 20 eV were allowed to enter the mass spectrometer. This version of energy filtering (Extreme Energy Filtering) described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Schauer and Williams (1990)</ref> has been used successfully to measure oxygen isotope ratios in natural samples <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Hervig et al., 1992)</ref>. Typ-  <ref type="bibr">'70, and 'sO were 86000, 30, and 200, respectively.</ref> No correction was applied for mass fractionation during sputtering or for that OCcutting within the flight tube. Each isotope was counted for 10 s. Scans were performed with 20 or 40 #m step intervals across the interdiffusion zone of each couple.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">RESULTS</head><p>Simple diffusion couples of anhydrous basalt were reacted at temperatures from 1320-1600°C and pressures of 1 and 2 GPa (Table <ref type="table">2</ref>).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">DISCUSSION</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Temperature Dependence</head><p>Two features of the diffusion data for basaltic liquid summarized in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> are noteworthy. First, although Do* is consistently larger than D* s~ for a given temperature, as anticipated from previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Towers and Chipman, 1957;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Koros and King, 1962;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Oishi et al., 1975</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Oishi et al., , 1982))</ref>, the differences are small ( &lt; 10%) and statistically insignificant at 1 GPa. Second, the activation energy found at 1 GPa is small (170 kJ mol-~ ) compared to previous determinations for oxygen diffusion. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Muehlenbachs and Kushiro (1974)</ref> reported an activation energy of 377 kJ mol -j for oxygen self diffusion in Icelandic basalt at 1 atm, while Canil and Muehlenbachs (1990) used the same liquid-gas exchange technique to determine that Eo* was 251 kJ mol -~ for Fe-, Ti-rich basaltic melt. Similarly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Shimizu and Kushiro (1984)</ref> reported that the activation energy for oxygen self diffusion in jadeite melt at 1.5 GPa was ~255 kJ tool -~ . <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Dunn (1982)</ref> reported a considerably smaller value for oxygen diffusion (185 kJ mo1-1 ) in Di40An60 melt at 1 atm, but found that the value increased to 264 kJ mol-~ for the diopside endmember although the associated uncertainty was ___84 kJ mol-~.</p><p>Molecular dynamics simulations predict activation energies much lower than most values determined from experiments. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Kubicki and Lasaga (1988)</ref> calculated an activation energy of 91 kJ mol ~ for oxygen self diffusion in SiO2 melt. Similarly, they estimated an activation energy of 102 kJ mol -~ for Si self diffusion. Even lower values are reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Soules (1979)</ref>, who simulated diffusive transport in Na silicate melt. Values of 184 and 166 kJ mol J were computed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Wasserman et al. (1991)</ref> for the self diffusion of Si and O, respectively, in liquid MgSiO3.</p><p>NMR studies also yield activation energies for network diffusion smaller than most previous experimental determinations and in the range predicted by MD simulations. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Farnan and Stebbins (1990)</ref> estimated from 29Si spinlattice relaxation timescales an apparent activation energy of 131-139 kJ mol-~ for network motions in albite melt. They also reported a value of ~179 kJ mol -j for K-tetrasilicate glass derived from a line-shape analysis, and showed that the value was almost identical to the activation energy for viscous flow of the same composition melt determined by <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Shartsis et al. (1952)</ref>. Although a significant range in activation energies for diffusion is reported from both experimental and theoretical studies, there is no a priori reason to dismiss any of these determinations at present. For example, non-Arrhenian behavior is well-established passing through the glass transition for a number of species (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Ricbet et al., 1986)</ref>, and molecular dynamic simulations to very high pressure suggest there may also be a sizable pressure dependence on E* <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Angell et al., 1982</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Angell et al., , 1988;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Kubicki and Lasaga, 1988)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Schaeffer (1974)</ref> also showed that activation energy for the networkformer silicon depends on the extent of covalency of the T-O bonds and therefore should vary with polymerization. This expectation contrasts with the <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Henderson et al. (1985)</ref> report that E* for network modifiers (i.e., Fe, Eu, Mn, and Co) of natural melts varies little with bulk composition, a conclusion also reached by <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Lesher (1994)</ref> in a study of Sr and Nd self diffusion in basaltic and rhyolitic melts. Thus, the broad range in reported values may relate not only to experimental conditions, but perhaps more importantly to composition, and hence, polymerization states of liquids.</p><p>The demonstration for liquid basalt that self diffusion coefficients for O are not significantly larger than those for Si provides an important constraint on models of network diffusion. For example, given the strong association of Si and O responsible for the anionic structure of melts, the similarity in diffusion behavior of Si and O would seem to necessitate that roughly an equivalent number of Si-O bonds are disrupted during diffusive transport of O and Si. Likewise, the comparatively small activation energy (i.e., ~50% of the total Si-O bond energy) limits this number to only a few. These deductions are inconsistent with the expectations for ionic diffusion where activation of Si 4+ would require disruption of four Si-O bonds and activation of O 2-would require disrupting only two. The diffusion results for basaltic liquid argues for a more cooperative process of network diffusion in which some proportion of O remains associated with Si during transport.</p><p>In transition state theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Glasstone et al., 1941 )</ref>, the activation energy is often equated with the sum of the energy required to launch a species for a diffusive jump (qh) and the energy needed to form a landing site (q[) for the species. Relative magnitudes of these energies during cooperative diffusion of the network formers are not clear, but <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Lesher and Walker ( 1991 )</ref> showed from Soret diffusion studies of natural basaltic and andesitic melts that the difference qh --qt, or heat of transport (Q*), for network formers is small and in the range of ~ -10 kJ mol-~. The heat of transfer is the enthalpy change that occurs on diffusion of these species from one temperature to another along the gradient. The negative value reflects the fact that network formers diffuse toward high T, while network-modifiers diffuse to the cooler region of the gradient. The fact that the absolute value of qh --qt is small for network formers suggests that the configurational changes during diffusive motion of network formers are minor.</p><p>Configurational changes induced by Soret diffusion are similar to those deduced from the temperature dependence for homogeneous reactions for silicate melt species. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Brandriss and Stebbins (1988)</ref> quantified changes in the proportion of Qn species with increasing temperature in a number of simple silicate liquids, where Q is the tetrahedral species sharing n oxygens with neighboring tetrahedra. They proposed the disproportionation reaction 2Q 3 ~ Q4 + Q2, and determined that AH ° for the reaction was 30 _+ 15 kJ tool -~ (also see <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Seifert et al., 1981 )</ref>. The small enthalpy change associated with this reaction implies that, although changes in the proportion of Q" species are detectable with temperature, conversion of one Q" species to another contributes little to the configurational heat capacity of silicate liquids. In other words, changes in temperature influence the relative proportion of Qn species, but do little to change the population of bridging oxygen bonds. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Brandriss and Stebbins (1988)</ref> concluded that the well-known decrease in the viscosity of silicate liquids with increasing temperature was related more directly to an increase in the frequency of Si-O bond breaking than to a decrease in the number of Si-O-Si linkages (a decrease in polymerization, by most definitions).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Eyring Correlation</head><p>Additional evidence as to configuration of network diffusion units is provided by consideration of the Eyring relation; D* = kTIrlh, where k is the Boltzmann constant, 77 is viscosity of the melt at temperature T, and h is the mean translation distance for the diffusive jump. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Oishi et al. (1975)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Yinnon and Cooper (1980)</ref> demonstrated good agreement between measured oxygen diffusivities for simple silicate melts and values computed using the Eyring relation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Shimizu and Kushiro (1984)</ref> also proposed on the basis of the Eyring relation that 0 2-mobility is the rate-limiting step for viscous flow in melts of geologic interest, while <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Rubie et al. (1993)</ref> discussed the relevance of the Eyring relation for polymerized Na2Si409 liquid up to 10 GPa, provided the mean jump distance for oxygen is on the order of its diameter (2.8 A). <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Dunn (1982)</ref> considered an alternative formulation of the Eyring relation more appropriate for nonspherical species, but found that neither the simplified nor more complex model could reproduce the diffusion data for melts along the diopside-anorthite join unless the jump distance was considerably larger than 2.6 ,/k. On this basis, <ref type="bibr">Duma (1982)</ref> proposed that the (SiO4) 4-monomer was an important diffusion unit, although he did not preclude ionic diffusion of oxygen.</p><p>For comparison, the network former diffusion data obtained in the present study are compared to melt viscosity in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>, and the results are related to solutions of the simplified Eyring equation given above for values of k ranging from 0.5-4 times the diameter of an oxygen ion, assumed here to be 2.8/~. Melt viscosities are calculated for 1 atm using the method of <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Shaw (1972)</ref>, with estimated corrections for pressure indicated by the vertical lines extending to lower values of In 77 (see Fig. <ref type="figure">3 caption</ref>). The In 0-In D* relationship shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> for basaltic liquid indicates a mean ionic translation distance that is a factor of 2-4 larger than the oxygen diameter, consistent with the conclusion reached by <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Dunn (1982)</ref> for diopside-anorthite join liquids. Although these calculations suffer somewhat from uncertainties in estimating the viscosity at 1-2 GPa, even the 1 arm values, which represent upper limits for rl, are displaced below the correlation line for ), = 2.8 ,A. Furthermore, emphasis should be given to the fact that the estimated translation distances (h) for Si and O are identical, and comparable to the Si-Si separation distance. </p></div>

Moreover, this estimate of the activation volume for network diffusion is nearly identical to the value for oxygen self diffusion in jadeite melt reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Shimizu and Kushiro (1984)</ref> and as noted by the authors, although negative, is about the molar volume of the oxygen ion. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Shimizu and Kushiro (1984)</ref> interpreted their results for jadeite melt as reflecting collapse of the "open" anionic structure during activation of 0 2-for diffusion. They contrasted the negative pressure dependence for jadeite melt with the opposite relationship found for diopside. In the latter case the positive activation volume, also within 12% of the molar volume of oxygen, was interpreted to reflect the shouldering aside required for activating 0 2-in the more closely packed depolymerized structure for liquid diopside. In both cases, the similarity in the absolute magnitude of activation volumes to the molar volume of oxygen supported the ionic diffusion model.</p><p>Alternatively, the negative activation volume found for partially polymerized basalt could reflect the densification of the anionic structure on forming the distorted ts]Si transition state as proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Angell et al. (1982)</ref>. The enhanced rate of diffusion of network formers with pressure shown by MD simulations has been specifically related to reduction of Si-O-Si bond angles, disproportionation of Q sites (i.e., 2Q 3 --* 0 4 + Qa; 2Q2 ~ Q3 + Ql), and concomitant stabilization of [5]Si and [6]Si <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Angell et al., 1982</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Angell et al., , 1988))</ref>. [s]Si and [6]Si coordination states have been reported in KeZi409 liquid quenched from as low as 1.9 GPa <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Stebbins and McMillan, 1989)</ref>, but in concentrations --&lt;1.1%. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Xue et al. ( 1989</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Xue et al. ( , 1991 ) )</ref> found that for liquids quenched from comparable pressure the proportion of IsISi and ¿61Si species varies with composition, with a general tendency for high-coordinated Si to be more abundant in partially depolymerized melts than in tectosilicate compositions. In view of these observations, there is no reason why E, for basalt and jadeite should be so similar given anticipated differences in the degree of polymerization of these liquids. The close correspondence between Va for molten basalt at moderate pressures and the oxygen volume should then probably be considered fortuitous and not a direct measure of the volume of the activated complex. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Liu et al. (1988)</ref> proposed that the formation of high-coordinated Si in partially polymerized melts occurs through asso- Jadeite melt <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[Shimizu &amp; Kushiro, 1984]</ref> .  <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Canil and Muehlenbachs (1990)</ref>. O self diffusion results of <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Shimizu and Kushiro (1984)</ref> for jadeite melt are shown for comparison. Note that activation volumes for network former diffusion up to 2 GPa are comparable for basalt and jadeite melts. ciation of neighboring Q~, Q2, or Q3 species with Q4 species and the local conversion of nonbridging to bridging oxygen. A schematic of this diffusion model modified after <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Xue et al. (1991)</ref> is presented in Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref> (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">McMillan et al., 1994)</ref>. The successful translation of network formers from one anion to another is envisioned to first involve formation of high-coordinated Si through the conversion of a nonbridging to bridging oxygen, followed by disruption of one of five bridge bonds, returning the species to tetrahedral coordination. For this diffusion mode, transfer involves a net exchange of one O-Si pair between anionic species. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Xue et al. (1991)</ref> suggested the reaction Q3 + Q4 = Q4, + ts]Si ' where Q4, represents the original Q3 species now sharing one oxygen with the newly formed t5]Si species. To complete the transfer of the O-Si pair between large silicate anions, the return of high-coordinated Si to tetrahedral coordination would have to result in creation of a new Q3 species by severing a different bridging bond, and leaving the original Q3 (now Q4) species associated. Although other transfer reactions can be envisioned, exchange of O-Si pairs appears to be common to those for which tsJsi is an intermediate structural state. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Liu et al. (1988)</ref> suggested that for low to moderate pressures these distorted Si sites are not long-lived, but revert back to more stable 14JSi configurations. For relatively small perturbations, species return to their original positions with no permanent change in local structure. However, sporadically they do not, and Si and associated oxygen are transferred from one anionic species to another. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Liu et al. (1988)</ref> drew an analogy between this form of structural mobility and that responsible for viscous flow, but made it clear that these highcoordination intermediate structural states are quenchable configurations, and are not necessarily equivalent to the activation complexes involved in either diffusion or viscous flow. For liquid basalt, the cooperative diffusion model proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Liu et al. (1988)</ref> offers an explanation for the similarities in Si and O self diffusion coefficients and low activation energies for network formers. We are also tempted to relate the negative activation volume found for molten basalt (Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>) to volume reduction on formation of briefly associated species such as Q4, + t~]Si (Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.">Cooperative Diffusion Model for Network Formers</head><p>An alternative interpretation of our experimental results that could account for the equivalence of Si and O self diffusivities would be the formation of the neutral molecule Sit2 as a transition-state complex, as proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Towers and Chipman (1957)</ref>. In this case, creation of molecular Sit2 would require severing two Si-O linkages of Q2 species that would certainly require less energy than required to launch either 0 2 or Si 4+ independently. The two dangling oxygen left behind would be available to locally charge balance network modifiers shed during formation of molecular Sit&gt; No net transfer of charge is expected by this mode of network diffusion, but it is anticipated that the formation of a neutral molecule of Sit2 would be associated with a positive, rather than negative, activation volume.</p><p>It is worth noting that the positive activation volume determined for liquid diopside by <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Shimizu and Kushiro (1984)</ref> is consistent with this latter model of cooperative diffusion and may be a viable network diffusion process for natural silicate liquids that are less polymerized than basalt. Further work is needed to establish the state of polymerization when the sign of Va (i.e., pressure dependence) changes, possibly signaling a fundamental change in the configuration of the network diffusion unit.</p><p>It is anticipated that in highly polymerized melts, where nonbridging oxygens are scarce, cooperative motions of Si and O will become more difficult. Cooperative mechanisms such as discussed above may be replaced by activation of individual ions, possibly facilitated by structural defects or vacancies. Activating Si 4+ for diffusion requires breaking four Si-O linkages in a fully polymerized melt, while activating 0 2-requires severing only two cation-O linkages. Clearly, if network species diffusion is an ionic process in fully polymerized melts, it will be energetically more difficult to launch Si than O. In this regard, we recall that the early studies of Ca aluminosilicate slag composition (-40CaO-20A1203-40SiO2; wt%) <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Towers and Chipman, 1957;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Koros and King, 1962;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Oishi et al., 1975</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Oishi et al., , 1982) )</ref> showed that D* --&gt; 10D*, although self diffusion coefficients for O and Si were not actually established for the same couples.</p><p>The expectation that D* &gt; D* for natural liquids more silicic than basalt is generally consistent with the effects of polymerization on network self diffusion shown in MD simulations <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Angell et al., 1982</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Angell et al., , 1988</ref>; among others) and reported in a recent high pressure experimental study of Na2Si40 9 liquid <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Diefenbacher et al., 1993)</ref>. Likewise, the lack of nonbridging oxygen in liquid jadeite precludes cooperative motion of network formers by the mechanism prescribed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Liu et al. (1988)</ref>. Indeed, reduction in free volume during the compression of liquid jadeite found in MD simulations has been attributed to the increased stability of HSi that leads to enhanced diffusion of all network formers with pressure, but this conversion to high coordination states is interpreted to occur largely through distortions in T-O-T bonds and formation of three-coordinated oxygen species <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Angell et al., 1982</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Angell et al., , 1988;;</ref><ref type="bibr">Stolper and Arhens, 1987)</ref>. The limitations in cooperative motion of the network formers in jadeite melts also appear to be reflected in the marked differences in the magnitude of Si and O self diffusion coefficients predicted by MD modeling <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Angell et al., 1982)</ref>, in contrast to the relations shown here for liquid basalt. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Xue et al. (1991)</ref> noted that the conversion of nonbridging to bridging oxygen to form high-coordinated Si is possible in partially polymerized melts, but is not a viable mechanism for tectosilicates. Thus, silicate liquids likely display a range of network diffusion behaviors depending on composition, pressure, and temperature, with the cooperative processes playing a more important role in moderately polymerized systems and ionic diffusion dominating in fully polymerized liquids. Systematic studies of Si and O self diffusion in silicic compositions at moderate to high pressure are underway to provide direct comparison with the diffusion phenomenon for moderately polymerized melts examined in this study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">CONCLUDING REMARKS</head><p>This study demonstrates the benefits of simultaneously characterizing self diffusion coefficients of the chief melt constituents of silicate liquids. When directly compared, the diffusive behavior of network formers can provide insights into the cooperative nature of network diffusion that in turn bears on the structural constitution, in general, and viscous flow and diffusion, specifically, of magmatic liquids. Data presented here for network diffusion in partially polymerized liquid basalt are consistent with a largely cooperative process involving the formation of high-coordinated (fivefold, sixfold) Si as a transition-state complex, as proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Liu et al. (1988)</ref>. Because of the requirement that nonbridging oxygens be available for formation of high-coordinated Si, we speculate that cooperative motion of Si and O will be limited in more polymerized melts. This hypothesis needs experimental verification.</p><p>The inferred changes in configuration of network-diffusion units have important implications for the application of transport models such as the Eyring relations, where proper identification of the oxygen translation distance h is required for the correlation to be valid. The viscosities of all but perhaps the most silicic natural silicate liquids will likely be underestimated using the Eyring relation, assuming that oxygen diffusion is purely ionic.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>FIG. 1.
