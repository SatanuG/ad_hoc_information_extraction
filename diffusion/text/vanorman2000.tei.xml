<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Phase equilibrium and dissolution kinetics experiments on synthetic late-stage magma ocean cumulates are used to place constraints on hypotheses for the origin of lunar high-Ti ultramafic glasses. Models for the production of high-Ti lunar magmas have called for either (1) assimilation of late-stage clinopyroxene-ilmenite cumulates at shallow levels or (2) sinking of clinopyroxene-ilmenite cumulates to form a hybrid mantle source. To satisfy the constraints of our experiments, we propose an alternative model that involves shallow-level reaction and mixing of cumulates, followed by sinking of hybrid high-Ti materials. This model can fulfill compositional requirements imposed by the pristine lunar glass suite that are difficult to satisfy in assimilation models. It also avoids difficulties that arise in overturn models from the low solidus temperatures of clinopyroxene-ilmenite cumulates. Partially molten clinopyroxene-ilmenite cumulates become gravitationally unstable with respect to underlying mafic cumulates only when they have cooled to within -30 "C of their solidus (-1 125 "C at 100 km depth). At these temperatures, the viscosity of mafic cumulates is too high to allow for growth and descent of clinopyroxene-ilmenite diapirs on the appropriate time scale. Reaction and mixing between late-stage liquids and mafic cumulates at shallow levels would produce a refractory hybrid material that is negatively buoyant at higher temperatures and could sink more efficiently to the depths inferred for production of high-Ti ultramafic glasses.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>Lunar volcanic glasses vary widely in composition, particularly in their content of  wt% Ti02; <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Delano, 1986)</ref>. The high-Ti contents of these glasses are usually attributed to ilmenitebearing cumulates that crystallized during late stages of magma ocean differentiation (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Anderson, 1971;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Taylor and Jakes, 1974;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Hubbard and Minear, 1975;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Ringwood and Kesson, 1976;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Hess, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Snyder et al., 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr">Shearer and</ref><ref type="bibr">Papike, 1993, 1999b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Hess and Parmentier, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Wagner and Grove, 1997)</ref>. The role of latestage cumulates in lunar volcanism remains a subject of debate. Different models have called for assimilation of these cumulates by ascending low-Ti magmas (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Hubbard and Minear, 1975;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Wagner and Grove, 1997)</ref> or global-scale overturn of the magma ocean cumulate pile to produce a heterogeneous mantle source (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Ringwood and Kesson, 1976;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Hess and Parmentier, 1995)</ref>. Each of these models implies a different chemical distribution within the lunar mantle following magma ocean solidification, and each may have different consequences for the subsequent thermal evolution of the Moon <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Hess and Parmentier, 1995)</ref>. The experiments in this paper place constraints on hypotheses for high-Ti ultramafic magma production by providing information on the melting behavior of clinopyroxene-ilmenite source materials.</p><p>Models for the origin of lunar ultramafic glasses begin with the concept of an early magma ocean differentiation event, as originally proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Smith et al. (1970)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Wood et al. (1970)</ref>. Crystallization of the magma ocean produced a layered pile of chemically diverse cumulate zones, with olivine and orthopyroxene forming the base of the pile and plagioclase floating upward to form the anorthositic crust (Taylor and Jakes, 1974; Walker et al., 1975a;  Longhi, 1977; Snyder et al., 1992). Cumulates produced late in the crystallization sequence (after -95% crystallization) were enriched in Ti, Fe, and other incompatible elements, and crystallized as a -20 km thick layer near the base of the crust (at -100 km depth).</p><p>These late-stage cumulates are thought to be composed primarily of clinopyroxene and ilmenite.</p><p>Early models called for production of lowand high-Ti magmas from different levels within the layered cumulate pile. Low-Ti liquids were thought to be produced from mafic cumulates at lower levels, and high-Ti liquids were thought to be formed by melting of late-stage cumulates at shallow depths (Taylor and Jakes, 1974;  Walker et al., 1975b). This conception proved inconsistent with later experimental results. Both low-and high-Ti ultramafic glass compositions are saturated with olivine plus orthopyroxene at similar pressures <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Green et al., 1975;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Delano, 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Chen et al., 1982;</ref><ref type="bibr">Chen and Lindsley, 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Wagner and Grove, 1997)</ref>, which suggests a similar depth of origin for all ultramafic glasses (-400 km). Also, neither clinopyroxene nor ilmenite is saturated on the liquidus of any pristine high-Ti ultramafic glass at any pressure <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Kesson, 1975;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Delano, 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Wagner and Grove, 1997)</ref>, and this rules out a high-Ti magma source that is composed predominantly of clinopyroxene and ilmenite. Subsequent models have had to take into account these experimental restrictions.</p><p>One set of models involves in situ assimilation of clinopyroxene-ilmenite cumulates by low-Ti ultrarnafic liquids <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Anderson, 1971;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Hubbard and Minear, 1975;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Wagner and Grove 1997)</ref>. In these models, the cumulate pile maintains its original layered structure. Low-Ti liquids are produced at depth by partial melting of mafic cumulates, and these magmas assimilate late-stage cumulates on their way to the surface to produce high-Ti magmas. Assimilation models have had difficulty accounting for some of the compositional traits of high-Ti ultramafic glasses. To satisfy major element mass balance (in particular the CaO/Ti02 ratio), the proportions of ilmenite and clinopyroxene entering the liquid must be approximately 3:l <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Wagner and Grove, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr">Shearer and Papike, 1999a)</ref>. In contrast, the relative abundance of ilmenite and clinopyroxene in late-stage cumulates is thought to be 1:5 to 1.6 (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Snyder et al., 1992)</ref>. Severe nonmodal assimilation, favoring ilmenite over clinopyroxene, thus seems to be required. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Wagner and Grove (1997)</ref> suggested that a disequilibrium dissolution process might lead to selective assimilation of ilmenite but did not have the experimental data to evaluate this model in detail. Our experiments provide a test of the clinopyroxene-ilmenite assimilation model and show that assimilation processes, whether equilibrium or disequilibrium, can not account for the compositions of lunar high-Ti ultramafic glasses.</p><p>A second model for high-Ti magma production involves overturn of the gravitationally unstable magma ocean cumulate pile to produce a mixed, hybrid lunar mantle <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Ringwood and Kesson, 1976;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Herbert, 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Hess, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Spera, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Hess and Parmentier, 1995)</ref>. Partial melting within this heterogeneous mantle is thought to account for the compositions of low-and high-Ti ultramafic glasses. An important constraint on overturn models is the temperature at which the high-Ti layer becomes negatively buoyant with respect to underlying mafic cumulates. Residual high-Ti liquids are less dense than mafic cumulates and must partially solidify before the high-Ti layer becomes gravitationally unstable. Our experiments on the phase relations of clinopyroxene-ilmenite cumulates allow us to predict the temperature at which clinopyroxene-ilmenite cumulates become denser than mafic cumulates. Estimates of the viscosity at this temperature allow us to calculate rates of growth and descent of clinopyroxene-ilmenite cumulate diapirs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>EXPERIMENTAL AND ANALYTICAL METHODS</head><p>The experiments in this paper were designed to characterize the melting and dissolution behavior of clinopyroxene-ilmenite cumulates under lunar mantle conditions. The solidus to liquidus phase relations of a synthetic high-Ti cumulate composition were determined under dry, reducing conditions in the pressure range 0.1 MPa to 1.8 GPa. These experiments yield information on the proportions and compositions of solid and liquid phases as functions of temperature and pressure and provide a test for petrogenetic models that involve mixing between partial melts of clinopyroxeneilmenite cumulates and low-Ti ultramafic liquids. We also performed two groups of dissolution experiments to determine the behavior of clinopyroxene-ilmenite cumulates during disequilibrium melting, dissolution, or both. The first group of experiments was designed to measure the rate of clinopyroxene dissolution into a low-Ti lunar basalt, for comparison with ilmenite dissolution rates determined by <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Wagner and Grove (1997)</ref>. The second group was designed to measure the rate of melt production at the interface between clinopyroxene and ilmenite single crystals, and the relative rates of dissolution of clinopyroxene and ilmenite into the growing melt layer.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Phase Equilibrium Experiments</head><p>Starting Materials-Phase equilibrium experiments were performed on a model high-Ti cumulate composition (TiCum; see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>) similar to that proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Snyder et al. (1992)</ref> for the solid assemblage that would precipitate after -95% crystallization of the lunar magma ocean. In the Snyder et al. (1992) model, most of the plagioclase floats upward to form the lunar crust, but a small amount (2-5% of the total) remains with the denser mush, and this bit of entrained plagioclase accounts for the modest A1203 content of the composition.</p><p>A mechanical mixture of the TiCum composition was prepared from high-purity oxides and silicates ground in an agate mortar under ethanol for 6 h.</p><p>0.1 MPa Experiments-Experiments at 0.1 MPa pressure were performed under a controlled atmosphere at temperatures that spanned the solidus and liquidus of the high-Ti cumulate composition. A pressed pellet of TiCum powdered mix was sintered onto a 0.8 mm diameter P$1-93-Fe,-~ loop that was chosen to minimize Fe exchange with the TiCum composition. The loop and pellet were suspended in the hotspot of a Deltech DT3 1 VT vertical gas mixing furnace. Oxygen fugacity was controlled near the quartz-fayalite-magnetite (QFM) buffer by mixing C02 and H2 gases and was continuously monitored with a solid ZrOz-CaO electrolyte 0 sensor calibrated against the FeFeO, Ni-NiO, and Cu-Cu20 buffers. Temperature was monitored using a Pt-PtgORhlo thermocouple calibrated against the melting points of NaCI, Au, and Pd on the IPTS 1968 temperature scale. The thermocouple junction was placed immediately adjacent to the experimental charge, and temperatures are believed to be accurate within &amp;2 "C. Experiments were run at constant temperature for 24 to 148 h and were terminated by drop-quenching the charge into a water bath.</p><p>High-pressure Experiments-The starting material for the highpressure experiments was prepared by pressing -0.5 g of TiCum powdered mix into a large pellet. The pellet was hung on 0.1 mm Pt wire and conditioned below the solidus for 39 h at 1050 "C and 0-fugacity corresponding to the Fe-FeO buffer, using the same furnace and techniques employed for the 0.1 MPa experiments. The sintered pellet was then ground to a fine powder in an agate mortar. Approximately 10 mg of the conditioned starting material was loaded into a graphite crucible and then placed in a Pt outer capsule that was open at one end. After drying for 12-48 h at 120 "C, the Pt outer capsule was welded shut, placed into a high-density A1203 sleeve, and centered in a straight-walled graphite furnace using crushable MgO spacers. The pressure medium consisted of a sintered BaCO3 sleeve. Pressure for this assembly was calibrated using the Ca-Tschermakite breakdown reaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Hays, 1966)</ref>. The pressure correction was found to be &lt;0.1 GPa at 1.3 GPa and 1350 "C, and the values reported in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> do not include a friction correction.

A 10 nA beam current and 15 kV accelerating potential were used for all analyses. A 2 p m beam diameter was used for analysis of solid phases, and a 10 p m beam diameter was used for glass analyses. Data were reduced using the phi-rho-z correction scheme.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Clinopyroxene Dissolution Experiments</head><p>Dissolution of clinopyroxene in a synthetic analog of Luna 24 low-Ti basalt was measured at temperatures between 1270 and 1450 "C and pressures of 1 .O to 1.3 GPa (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref>). The design of the experiments was similar to those of Zhang et al. (1989) and Wagner and Grove (1 997). A single crystal of gem-quality diopside from the Kunlun Mountains, China (Table <ref type="table">I</ref>), was cut perpendicular to the c axis into wafers -1 m m thick using a low-speed diamond wafering saw. The Kunlun Mountains diopside is higher in CaO and MgO and lower in FeO than pyroxenes expected to precipitate during late stages of magma ocean crystallization. As discussed below, dissolution of Kunlun Mountains diopside in basaltic magmas is probably slower than dissolution of a more Fe-rich pyroxene, and thus the rates we report below are probably lower limits for the assimilation process under consideration. The</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Melting Kinetics Experiments</head><p>The rate of melt production at the interface between diopside and ilmenite single crystals was determined at 1.3 GPa and temperatures of 1300-1350 "C (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">6</ref>). Kunlun Mountains diopside and Frank Smith ilmenite single crystals (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>) were cut with a diamond wafering saw into parallelepipeds of approximately equal size. One side of each piece was polished with diamond pastes to 0.3 p m grit. The polished face of the diopside crystal was oriented perpendicular to the c axis; polished ilmenite faces were oriented randomly. Ilmenite and diopside pieces were placed together with their polished surfaces in contact in a tightly fitting graphite capsule (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>) and were held at constant temperature and pressure in a piston cylinder device. As with the single crystal diopside dissolution experiments, the assembly was pressed cold and brought quickly to run temperature (at 200 "Chin) and was quenched by shutting off the power. The initial and final thickness of the ilmenite and diopside crystals were measured using the techniques described above for the clinopyroxene single crystal dissolution experiments. Quench crystallization was especially pervasive in these experiments, because of the highly depolymerized nature of the melt produced, making it difficult to measure concentration profiles in quenched glass between the ilmenite and diopside crystals. In one experiment (B634) that preserved a few large pools of glass, it was possible to measure a portion of the concentration profile using the electron microprobe.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">69(0.14)  0.60(0.10)  9.82(0.20)  0.62(0.10)   0.78(0.11)   0.85(0.05)   7</ref>  <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">08(0.08)  0.1 l(0.03)  3.11(0.04)  0.13(0.06)  3.32(0.05)  0.1 7(0.05)  3.80(0.04)  0.3 l(0.09)   5</ref>  <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">4)  3 1.2(0.2)   22.6( I .O)   31.3(0.3)  23.7(0.7)  3 1.6(0.3)  25.3(0.4)  30.2(0</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results of Phase Equilibrium Experiments</head><p>The subsolidus to near-liquidus phase relations of the synthetic high-Ti cumulate were determined up to 1.3 GPa (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>). The sequence of phase appearances with decreasing temperature was similar at all pressures investigated. Clinopyroxene is the only phase saturated on the liquidus up to at least 1.3 GPa. Ilmenite is the next phase to crystallize with decreasing temperature, followed by trace amounts of tridymite and ulvospinel at 0.1 MPa, and quartz at 1.3 GPa. The subsolidus assemblage at 0.1 MPa is cpx + ilrn + plag; at 1.3 GPa, plagioclase has disappeared and the subsolidus phases are cpx + ilm. A single experiment at 1.8 GPa and 1290 "C, which produced liq + cpx, suggests that the phase relations are similar at higher pressure (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>).</p><p>Our results can be compared with those of <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Wyatt (1977)</ref>, who performed experiments between 2.0 and 4.8 GPa on starting material consisting of 29 WWO ilmenite and 71 wt?? clinopyroxene, with molar Mg# =0.638 (our high-Ti cumulate composition, in contrast, contains -14 wt% ilmenite and 86 wt% clinopyroxene, with Mg# = 0.311). <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Wyatt (1977)</ref> reported a nearly constant melting interval of -140 "C between 2.0 and 4.8 GPa, with clinopyroxene being the liquidus phase in all but one case. The liquidus and solidus of Wyatt's bulk composition, extrapolated to lower pressure, coincide with our liquidus and solidus within -20 "C. The similarity between our results and those of <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Wyatt (1977)</ref> suggests that the general aspects of the phase equilibria in clinopyroxene-ilmenite assemblages are not very sensitive to changes in bulk composition and pressure.</p><p>The near-solidus melting reactions for our high-Ti cumulate composition are given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">5</ref>. We ignore the trace amounts of ulvospinel and tridymite or quartz that are produced in experiments just above the solidus and consider the simplified melting equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">a cpx + / 3 ilm = I melt.</formula><p>Within the uncertainty limits, the stoichiometric coefficients for clinopyroxene and ilmenite in the melting reaction do not appear to change between 0.1 MPa and 1.3 GPa. However, the Ti02 content in the melt near the ilmeniteout phase boundary is -3 wtY0 higher at 1.3 GPa than at 0.1 MPa (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>), which suggests that there is actually a slight increase in the ratio of ilmenite to clinopyroxene entering the melt with increasing pressure.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results of Clinopyroxene Dissolution Experiments</head><p>The results of the experiments on diopside dissolution in synthetic Luna 24 basaltic liquid are summarized in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref>. Dissolution rates are given in terms of mass dissolved per square root run duration per square meter interfacial area between crystal and melt. The mass dissolved during the experiment was calculated from the change in thickness of the single crystal disk, assuming a diopside density of 3300 kg/m3. Dissolution rates are expressed in terms of mass, rather than distance, to facilitate comparison with ilmenite dissolution rates measured by <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Wagner and Grove (1997)</ref>. Dissolution rates are given with respect to the square root of the run duration because diffusion controlled dissolution proceeds linearly with t"2.</p><p>The dissolution rate can be estimated independently and chemical diffusion in the melt verified to be the rate-controlling mechanism by examining concentration profiles in the glass adjacent to the diopside disk. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref> shows Si02, TiO2, Alz03, and MgO concentration profiles from a dissolution experiment performed at 1350 "C and 1.3 GPa (B547). These components all appear to display normal diffusion behavior; there is no evidence for multicomponent coupling effects such as uphill diffusion. Not shown are concentration profiles for CaO and FeO, which were nearly flat over the interval measured and could not be used to extract effective binary diffusion coefficients nor to estimate the dissolution rate. The curves in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref> are fits to the data of an analytical solution for one-dimensional diffusion controlled dissolution into a semi-infinite melt reservoir <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Zhang et al., 1989)</ref>: where C , is the concentration in the melt at infinite distance from the interface, CO is the concentration in the melt at the interface, x is distance from the interface, t is run duration, and D is the effective binary diffusion coefficient in the melt. The parameter a satisfies <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Zhang et al., 1989)</ref>:</p><p>where C, is the concentration in the diopside crystal. The interface concentration CO is assumed to be constant throughout the duration of the experiment. This appears to be a very good approximation, at least in the case of diopside. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Zhang et al. (1989)</ref> have shown, using interface reaction rates for diopside inferred from the experiments of <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Kuo and Kirkpatrick (1985)</ref>, that the interfacial melt will attain a constant saturation condition in &lt;I s.</p><p>Effective binary diffusion coefficients obtained from fits to the Si02, TiO2, AI2O3, and MgO concentration profiles are given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">6</ref>. These provide an independent means of estimating the dissolution rate, using the relation <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Zhang et al., 1989)</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">rate = u p 6 (<label>3</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_3">)</formula><p>where p is diopside density and the rate is in units of g m-2 s-1' 2 (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">6</ref>).

The parameters C,v, C,, and Co are proportional to the equilibrium activity of a component with Kunlun Mountains diopside stoichiometry in the crystal, Luna 24 basaltic liquid, and the saturated interface melt, respectively. By this definition, C, is equal to 1, and C, can be calculated given an activity model for the melt. A value of 0.307 for C, is obtained using the solution model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Ghiorso and Sack (1995)</ref>. The temperature dependence of CO is expressed as d(ln CO)/ d(l/T) = Hf/R, where Hf is the enthalpy of fusion of Kunlun Mountains diopside. We used the MELTS Supplemental Calculator <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Ghiorso and Sack, 1995)</ref> to calculate Hf and Co for Kunlun Mountains diopside at the conditions of our experiments. Values of Hf are between 11 1 and 127 kJ/mol at temperatures of 1270 to 1450 "C and 1.3 GPa, and Co has values between 0.33 and 0.75 at the same conditions. Given values for C, and C, of 1 and 0.307, Eq. ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>) gives the relation between a and CO. This relation is approximately log linear, except when Co approaches C,. For 0.33 &lt; Co &lt; 0.75, the average value of d(ln a)/d(ln CO) is -3.4. Combined with the temperature dependence for CO given above, this gives d(ln a)/dln (I/T) sz 3.4 Hf/R. From Eq. ( <ref type="formula">4</ref>), an expression for the temperature dependence of Kunlun Mountains diopside dissolution in Luna 24 basalt at 1.3 GPa and 1270-1450 "C is then given by: This expression is an approximation of a more complicated functional form, and the factor of 3.4 multiplying the enthalpy of fusion holds only over the range of parameters we have estimated here.</p><p>The activation enthalpy for diffusion of network-forming components in andesitic to basaltic melts is typically 200-300 kJlmol (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Baker, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr">Zhang et af., 1989)</ref>. Taking a value of 250 kJ/mol for the diffusion activation enthalpy and 120 kJ/mol for the enthalpy of fusion of diopside, aln ratela(1lT) for our experiments at 1.3 GPa is predicted from Eq. ( 5 ) to have a value of -533 (kJ/mol)/R. This is in good agreement with the value of -503 (kJ/mol)/R determined from the fit to our experimental data (Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>).</p><p>Pressure DependenceThe dissolution rate for diopside at 1350 "C is significantly greater at 1.0 GPa than at 1.3 GPa (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref>, Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Brearley and Scarfe (1986)</ref> observed a similar increase in dissolution rate with decreasing pressure in their experiments on clinopyroxene dissolution in alkali basalt. Diffusion of networkforming cations in silicate melts has a modest pressure dependence (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Baker, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Shimizu and Kushiro, 1991)</ref> that is not sufficient and may be in the wrong sense to explain the pressure dependence of diopside dissolution rates. The pressure dependence is probably due mostly to the increase in diopside solubility with decreasing pressure. Using MELTS <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Ghiorso and Sack, 1995)</ref> as above to calculate the "saturated" activity of diopside in a melt at 1350 "C and 1.0-1.3 GPa, we find that the parameter a is expected to increase from -0.15 at 1.3 GPa to -0.24 at 1.0 GPa. This corresponds to a ratio of dissolution rates at 1.0 and 1.3 GPa of -1.6, which is in reasonable agreement with the measured ratio of 2.25 2 0.79 (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref>).</p><p>Comparison of Diopside and Ilmenite Dissolution Rates-The dissolution rates reported here for diopside at 1.3 GPa are significantly slower than ilmenite dissolution rates measured by <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Wagner and Grove (1997)</ref> in low-Ti lunar basalts at 1.0 GPa (Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>). Part of this difference in dissolution rates may be attributed to pressure; the dashed line in Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref> shows diopside dissolution rates shifted upward to pass through our data point at 1.0 GPa and 1350 "C. At low temperatures, there is still a significant difference in dissolution rates, even with the correction for pressure. However, at temperatures corresponding to the liquidus of lunar high-Ti glasses (-1400 "C for Apollo 14 black glass at I .O GPa; <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Wagner and Grove, 1997)</ref>, there is expected to be very little difference in the dissolution rates of ilmenite and diopside. Pyroxenes in high-Ti cumulates may dissolve even faster than the nearly pure diopside used in our experiments because they are closer in composition to the liquid they are dissolving into, particularly in terms of FeO, CaO, and MgO. In general, the smaller the compositional difference between mineral and melt, the faster the dissolution rate <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Zhang et al., 1989)</ref>. Thus our results for nearly pure diopside probably represent a lower limit for the dissolution rate of clinopyroxene in high-Ti cumulates.</p><p>*r-----I 5.8 5.9 6.0</p><p>6.1</p><p>6.2 6.3 6.4 6.5</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">-1 ' ' 1 O,OOO/T (K-') FIG. 5.</formula><p>Comparison of diopside and ilmenite dissolution rates in low-Ti lunar basaltic liquids.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results of Melting Kinetics Experiments</head><p>A summary of the results of diopside-ilmenite melting kinetics experiments is given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">7</ref>. Dissolution rates for ilmenite and diopside were estimated by measuring the initial and final thickness of the two crystals perpendicular to their interface. Densities of 3300 and 4600 kg/m3 for diopside and ilmenite, respectively, were used to convert the change in thickness to a change in mass.</p><p>Backscattered electron images of run products from two experiments at 1350 "C are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">6</ref>. In the longer experiment (8634; 6 h), the configuration is gravitationally stable, with diopside on top of ilmenite. The configuration is reversed in the shorter duration experiment (B653; 1 h), with ilmenite on top of diopside. In this case, there is a driving force for convective mixing between dense ilmenite-enriched melts at the top of the growing melt layer and diopside-enriched melts below. If convection were an important mechanism for mass transport in this experiment, one would expect the dissolution rate to be significantly more rapid than in the gravitationally stable experiment. The ilmenite dissolution rate is slightly higher in experiment B653, but the diopside dissolution rate is the same within the uncertainty of the measurement. Convection thus appears not to have a large influence on dissolution rates in these experiments.  In the melting kinetics experiments, the interface between ilmenite and melt is always observed to be smooth (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">6</ref>). The diopside-melt interface is more rugged, and relic blocks of diopside are suspended in the interstitial pool of melt. These blocks are probably the result of dissolution along cleavage cracks that formed during pressurization and heating of the experimental charge, as has been observed also by <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Greenwood and Hess (1998)</ref> in melting of superheated albite. Relic blocks were not observed in the experiments on diopside dissolution into Luna 24 basalt, probably because the diopside was surrounded by soft glass powder that absorbed most of the deformation during pressurization and prevented cleavage cracks from forming. In any case, the relic blocks represent a significant volume of undissolved material, and this was accounted for in estimating the amount of diopside that dissolved during the experiments.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">7</ref> shows a plot of ilmenite and diopside dissolution distances vs. the square root of the run duration for melting kinetics experiments run at 1350 "C. The linear dependence of dissolution distance on tln suggests that melting is controlled by diffusion. It is presumed that a saturation condition is maintained at each interface, such that the melt is saturated with diopside at the diopside-melt interface and with ilmenite at the ilmenitemelt interface. Growth of the melt layer is limited by diffkive transport of Ca, Si, and Mg away from the diopside interface and by complementary diffusive transport of Fe and Ti away from the ilmenite interface. In one experimental charge (B634), a significant portion of the concentration profile could be measured in quenched glass (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">8</ref>). Concentrations of SiOz and CaO increase smoothly across the melt layer from ilmenite to diopside, and Ti02 and FeO profiles have the opposite trend.</p><p>An Arrhenius plot showing the dissolution rates of ilmenite and diopside in the melting kinetics experiments is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref>. Diopside dissolves significantly faster than ilmenite at the conditions of the experiments. The trend of the data suggests that at higher temperatures (above -1 380 "C), the order of dissolution rates may reverse. The temperatures at which melting of high-Ti cumulates may take place in the Moon are bracketed by the solidus of the high-Ti cumulate and the liquidus of lunar ultramafic liquids. At temperatures near the solidus of the high-Ti cumulate (-1200 "C at 1.3 GPa), ilmenite is predicted to dissolve an order of magnitude more slowly than diopside with which it is in contact. At ultramafic glass liquidus temperatures (approximately 1400-1500 "C at 1.3 GPa) the melting rate will be very fast and dissolution rates of ilmenite and diopside will be similar. At 1400 "C, centimeter-sized grains will dissolve completely within hours.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p>Assimilation Model for High-Titanium Magma Genesis</p><p>The cumulate assimilation model must meet two requirements: there should be sufficient heat available to allow for assimilation, and the resulting melts must be similar in composition to those represented in the lunar ultramafic glass suite. Wagner and Grove 9. Arrhenius plot showing rates of dissolution of ilmenite and diopside into the melt layer formed at their mutual boundary, at 1.3 GPa. Ilmenite and diopside dissolution rates at 1.3 GPa can be described by: Rim (g m-2 = 4.72 x 1OZ6exp(-9.59 x 104/T);&amp;,= 1.17 x 10~9exp(4.71 x 104/7) (1997) evaluated the heat budget and found that it was sufficient to allow significant assimilation of clinopyroxene-ilmenite cumulates by low-Ti ultramafic magmas. Here we focus on the compositional constraints and ask whether an assimilation process can reproduce the compositional trend displayed by the pristine lunar ultramafic glasses.</p><p>Partial Fusion of Clinopyroxene-Ilmenite Cumulates-One mechanism for the chemical interaction of low-Ti magmas with late stage clinopyroxene-ilmenite cumulates involves heating and partial fusion of the cumulates. Do mixtures of clinopyroxene-ilmenite cumulate partial melts and low-Ti ultramafic magmas resemble high-Ti ultramafic glass compositions? The compositions of partial melts produced in our phase equilibrium experiments are compared with the compositions of pristine lunar glasses on a plot of CaO vs. Ti02 (Fig. <ref type="figure">10</ref>). The lunar glasses, shown as filled circles, form a trend of decreasing CaO with increasing TiO2. Partial melts of the clinopyroxene-ilmenite cumulate (open symbols) do not lie on this trend or its extension; they have significantly lower Ti02 and higher CaO concentrations than the highest Ti02 glasses. Thus, simple mixing of equilibrium partial melts of a clinopyroxene-ilmenite cumulate with a low-Ti parent liquid can not reproduce the compositional trend of the high-Ti glasses. Increasing the pressure of melting does not move clinopyroxene-ilmenite partial melts toward the compositions of the lunar glasses; the Ti02 content increases and CaO content decreases somewhat with pressure, but the shift in composition is small and more or less parallel to the lunar glass array. Neither can fractional crystallization cause hybrid liquids to evolve toward lunar glass compositions. Fractional crystallization of olivine or orthopyroxene will increase both the Ti02 and CaO concentrations, moving melts along a trajectory away from and nearly orthogonal to the trend of the lunar glasses. Fractionation of high-Ca pyroxene or plagioclase would move melts in the right direction, but this is not an option because pristine lunar glass liquids are not saturated with either of these phases at any pressure <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Kesson, 1975;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Delano, 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr"></ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Wagner and Grove, 1997)</ref>. For assimilation to meet the compositional constraints provided by the pristine lunar glass suite, a significantly higher ratio of ilmenite to clinopyroxene must enter the melt, on the order of -3: 1. Can a rapid disequilibrium melting process accomplish this? Our melting kinetics experiments indicate that it can not. Clinopyroxene dissolves more rapidly than ilmenite with which it is in contact, particularly at lower temperatures. At temperatures above 1350 "C, clinopyroxene may dissolve more rapidly than ilmenite, but the melting rate at these temperatures is so fast that solid cumulates are unlikely to be preserved at all. At 1400 "C, a 1 cm clinopyroxene grain in contact with ilmenite is predicted to dissolve completely in only a few hours. It is doubtful that a melting and mixing process could take place on such a short time scale.</p><p>Selective contamination may take place by diffusive fractionation in the melt (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Watson, 1982)</ref>, but this is unlikely to increase the TiOz/CaO ratio beyond that for simple binary mixing between the assimilating magma and the clinopyroxene-ilmenite partial melt. Titanium diffuses more slowly than Ca in basaltic liquids (e.g., LaTourrette et <ref type="bibr">al., 1996)</ref>, and thus diffusive fractionation would be likely to decrease rather than increase the Ti02/CaO ratio in the assimilating magma. Uphill diffusion could complicate matters but is unlikely to play a major role in chemical fractionation of Ti02 and CaO because both species have similar preferences for less polymerized liquids <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Zhang et al., 1989)</ref>.</p><p>Dissolution of Clinopyroxene and Ilmenite into Low-Titanium-Magmas-Another possible mechanism for assimilation of late stage cumulates involves dissolution of clinopyroxene and ilmenite directly into low-Ti magmas. This is unlikely to be a significant mechanism for assimilation of clinopyroxene-ilmenite cumulates, because dissolution at the boundary between clinopyroxene and ilmenite crystals is more rapid than dissolution of these minerals into low-Ti melts. At 1400 "C, the melting rate is predicted to be a factor of -3 faster than the dissolution rates of clinopyroxene and ilmenite into low-Ti melts (compare Figs. <ref type="figure">5</ref> and<ref type="figure">9</ref>). Thus, a clinopyroxene-ilmenite xenolith entrained in an ascending low-Ti magma would melt internally, at interfaces between clinopyroxene and ilmenite, faster than the individual minerals would dissolve into the entraining low-Ti magma. Dissolution of clinopyroxene and ilmenite into low-Ti liquids would be important only if clinopyroxene and ilmenite were not in physical contact. Even in this case, the dissolution rates of ilmenite and clinopyroxene are expected to be similar at ultramafic glass liquidus temperatures (see Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>), making selective assimilation of ilmenite unlikely. Selective assimilation could only take place at lower temperatures, where ilmenite does dissolve significantly faster than clinopyroxene. The assimilating liquid in this case would need to have a significantly lower liquidus temperature than any of the ultramafic glasses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hybrid Source Models</head><p>Assimilation of clinopyroxene-ilmenite cumulates by the processes described above does not account for the compositions of lunar high-Ti ultramafic glasses. An alternative is that the high-Ti glasses were generated during partial melting of a hybrid source region at depth. Arguments similar to those given above rule out simple mixing of melts from separate clinopyroxene-ilmenite and olivine-orthopyroxene cumulate sources. Mixing between clinopyroxene-ilmenite partial melts and low-Ti ultramafic magmas will lead to hybrid liquids deficient in Ti02 and enriched in CaO relative to high-Ti ultramafic glasses (see Fig. <ref type="figure">10</ref>). Instead, high-Ti lunar magmas must have equilibrated with a source that contained olivine f orthopyroxene in addition to clinopyroxene and ilmenite.</p><p>The prevailing model for creating such a source involves overturn of the gravitationally unstable magma ocean cumulate pile. Several variants of this model have been proposed. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Ringwood and Kesson (1976)</ref> envisioned clinopyroxene-ilmenite pods decoupling from overlying crust, sinking into the lunar mantle and partially melting and reacting with mafic cumulates at depth. The heterogeneous hybrid mantle resulting from this process was considered to be the source for high-and low-Ti ultramafic magmas and mare basalts. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Hess and Parmentier (1995)</ref> proposed that large clinopyroxene-ilmenite cumulate diapirs could have descended to the center of the Moon, carrying with them a significant complement of the Moon's radionuclides. In this version of the overturn model, the source region for high-Ti lunar magmas is thought to lie within a convectively mixed layer just above the radioactively heated clinopyroxene-ilmenite core.</p><p>The dynamics of cumulate pile overturn depend on the viscosity, which is strongly dependent on temperature. The temperature during overturn is constrained by the phase relations of clinopyroxene-ilmenite cumulates. The high-Ti layer becomes gravitationally unstable when the temperature has fallen near the solidus; more than -30 "C above the solidus, the high-Ti layer will be mostly molten (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>) and less dense than underlying mafic cumulates. Thus, when clinopyroxene-ilmenite diapirs begin to sink through underlying cumulates, the temperature cannot be far above 1125 "C (the solidus at 100 km depth). The viscosity of mafic cumulates at this temperature can be estimated using flow laws for dry olivine given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Karato and Wu (1993)</ref>. The viscosity in the power law creep regime is calculated to be in the range 1 x 1021 to 5 x 1023 Pa s, assuming that stresses are similar to those in Earth's convecting mantle (1 to 0.1 MPa). Similar viscosities are obtained for diffusion (Newtonian) creep; 1 x 1022 to 6 x 1023 Pa s for olivine grain sizes of 1 to 5 mm. These viscosities are much higher than have been used in models of cumulate pile overturn, where the temperature constraint has not been taken into account. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Hess and Parmentier (1995)</ref>, for example, assumed a viscosity for mafic cumulates of -1019 Pa s. This is a reasonable value for the early evolution of the magma ocean, when the temperature is near the solidus of mafic cumulates, but is too low to apply during sinking of the high-Ti layer, when the temperature is constrained to be near the clinopyroxene-ilmenite solidus.</p><p>The rate of settling of clinopyroxene-ilmenite diapirs through mafic cumulates can be calculated from Stokes' law. If the temperature gradient within the lunar mantle is adiabatic <ref type="bibr">(-0.15 "Ckm;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Finilla et al., 1994</ref>), there will be little change in the viscosity with depth. For a viscosity of 3 x 1022 Pa s (corresponding to power law creep with 0.3 MPa stress), and a density difference between clinopyroxene-ilmenite and mafic cumulates of 350 kg/m3, the settling rate in meters per second is calculated to be approximately I x 10-21 d 2, where d is the diameter of the diapir (assumed here to be spherical) in meters. Given this relation for the settling rate, we can calculate how far diapirs could descend into the lunar mantle in the -400 Ma available between complete solidification of the magma ocean and the onset of high-Ti volcanism on the Moon at -3.9 Ga. A cumulate diapir 40 km in diameter is calculated to fall only 20 km in this time. Only diapirs larger than about 180 km could descend to depths of several hundred kilometers where lunar ultramafic glasses are thought to be produced, and -360 km diapirs are required if cumulates are to descend to the lunar core.</p><p>A high-Ti cumulate layer evenly distributed beneath the lunar crust would be only -20 km thick <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Snyder et al., 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr"></ref>  Hess and  Parmentier, 1995), so diapirs would have to grow considerably to reach the -180 km size that is probably necessary for descent deep into the lunar mantle. Whether diapirs can grow large enough depends critically on the viscosity of the clinopyroxene-ilmenite cumulate layer. Analytical expressions for the growth time and characteristic wavelength of Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Whitehead, 1988</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Hess and Parmentier, 1995)</ref> indicate that the viscosity of clinopyroxene-ilmenite cumulates must be -3OOx less than the viscosity of mafic cumulates in order to grow diapirs 180 km in diameter within 100 Ma. Such a low viscosity seems unlikely, because clinopyroxene-dominated rocks in general are even stronger than olivine rocks (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Kirby and Kronenberg, 1984)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Hess and Parmentier (1995)</ref> suggested that a liquid phase that wets grain boundaries in the clinopyroxene-ilmenite cumulate might lower the viscosity enough to generate very large diapirs. Grain boundary wetting is rare in silicates <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Kohlstedt and Zimmerman, 1996)</ref> but whether it may occur in clinopyroxene-ilmenite rocks remains an open question. If melts do not wet grain boundaries, then it probably is not possible to generate clinopyroxene-ilmenite diapirs of the size required to transport clinopyroxene-ilmenite cumulates hundreds of kilometers into the lunar mantle.</p><p>The preceding analysis illustrates an essential problem in redistributing clinopyroxene-ilmenite cumulates to deep levels within the Moon. At the low temperatures that are needed to keep the clinopyroxene-ilmenite cumulates negatively buoyant, settling of diapirs through the cold, stiff mafic cumulates is difficult. This difficulty can be eased if the solidus of high-Ti material is increased so that overturn can take place at higher temperatures, where settling is more efficient. We suggest that physical mixing and chemical reaction between high-Ti liquids and mafic cumulates produced a refractory hybrid material at shallow levels, during late stages of magma ocean solidification. Large-scale transport of this hybrid material could be accomplished more easily than in the case of pure clinopyroxene-ilmenite cumulates. Calculations using the MELTS algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Ghiorso and Sack, 1995)</ref> indicate that the addition of as little as 20 wt% F O , ~ olivine to our TiCum composition would raise the solidus by -80 "C. The viscosity at this temperature would be an order of magnitude lower than at the solidus of clinopyroxeneilmenite cumulates. The density of this material would be at least 200 kg/m3 greater than that of mafic cumulates, and we calculate that diapirs as small as -60 km in diameter could descend several hundred kilometers into the lunar mantle within a few hundred million years. The time required for diapirs to develop would be on the order of -10 Ma.</p><p>Shallow-level hybridization is probably a natural consequence of the very long solidification time inferred for late-stage magma ocean liquids. Complete crystallization of late-stage liquids, after the formation of a stable anorthosite crust, is predicted to take 200Ma or more <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Solomon and Longhi, 1977)</ref>. During the long solidification process, late-stage liquids will react chemically with the mafic products of earlier fractional crystallization. Cumulates also may mix physically over short length scales, driven by gravitational instab es that develop during crystallization (e.g., Snyder et a/., 1992; <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Hess and Parmentier, 1995)</ref>. Reaction and mixing among late-stage liquids and mafic cumulates may have been enhanced by radioactive heating in the crust. It has been shown recently that a large proportion of the Moon's budget of radioactive elements may reside within a single crustal province on the nearside (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Haskin, 1998)</ref>. Heat produced in this highly radiogenic crust may significantly slow the crystallization of latestage liquids <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Wieczorek and Phillips, 1999)</ref>, allowing more time for their interaction with mafic cumulates.</p></div>
