<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Na-K chemical interdiffusion between albite and orthoclase melts has been measured at 1.0 GPa between 800 and 1600°C and at 2.0 GPa, 1400°C, in anhydrous melts and in hydrous, 5.5 wt% H 2 O, melts at 1.0 GPa, 1200 and 1400°C. Anhydrous Na-K diffusivities at X or ϭ 0.5 display Arrhenian behavior even through the inferred glass transition. After correction for diffusion occurring during heating Na-K interdiffusion can be described by D ϭ 2.39(ϩ1.7,Ϫ0.98) ϫ 10 Ϫ5 exp(Ϫ145.8 Ϯ 6.8/RT) where D is the diffusion coefficient in m 2 s Ϫ1 , 145.8 is the activation energy in kJ mol Ϫ1 , R is the gas constant, and T is the temperature in kelvins. These diffusivities are four decades greater than estimated Si-Al diffusivities in the same melts due to the low alkali-oxygen bond valence, or cation field strength, and the abundance of appropriate charge-balanced locations for alkalis in alkali feldspar melts. Extrapolation of diffusion coefficients to 600 -650°C for comparison with Na-K interdiffusion in alkali feldspar crystals demonstrates that melting increases diffusion by six orders of magnitude. The effect of pressure on Na-K diffusion at 1400°C is not measurable in this system and suggests that only minor dilation of the coordinating oxygen polyhedra which enclose alkalis in the melt is necessary for diffusion. A preliminary Arrhenius equation for alkali diffusion in silicic melts with 6 Ϯ 0.5 wt% H 2 O was calculated using results of this and previous studies D ϭ 4.97(ϩ0.85,Ϫ0.73) ϫ 10 Ϫ6 exp(Ϫ115.8 Ϯ 1.8/RT).</p><p>The effect of H 2 O only increases diffusivities by approximately a factor of four, distinctly different from the three orders of magnitude differences between Si-Al, Zr, and P diffusion in anhydrous and hydrous granitic melts. The differing behavior of alkalis and these other cations in hydrous silicic melts is associated with differences in the type and abundance of coordination polyhedra and the low bond valences and cation field strengths of alkalis.</p></div>

Despite this potential, and despite the observation that Na and K are present in significant amounts in all igneous rocks, only a few studies have been dedicated to the measurement of alkali chemical diffusion <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Smith, 1974;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Watson and Jurewicz, 1984)</ref>.</p><p>Data are available on alkali tracer diffusion in synthetic glasses of different compositions <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Jambon and Carron, 1976;</ref><ref type="bibr">Beherens, 1992)</ref> and in complex natural melts <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Margaritz and Hofmann, 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Watson, 1981;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Jambon, 1982;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">van der Laan et al., 1994)</ref>. However, very few data are available on Na-K chemical interdiffusion which is the most common process in nature; often only K diffusivity is measured and an estimated value is given for Na <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Smith, 1974;</ref><ref type="bibr">Watson and Jurevicz, 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Baker, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr">Chekhmir and Epel'baum, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bai and Koster van Groos, 1994)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUES</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Glass Synthesis</head><p>Glasses of albite and orthoclase composition were used in these experiments. The glasses were made from reagent-grade SiO 2 , Al 2 O 3 , K 2 CO 3 , or Na 2 CO 3 . Oxides and carbonates were ground together under ethanol, decarbonated and melted in air. The orthoclase composition was melted at 1600°C, four times for 1 h, once for 3 h, and then, after adding 5 % of initial weight of K 2 CO 3 , once more for 14 h. The glass was crushed after each fusion and finally ground to a grain size of less than 70 m. The albite glass is that used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Baker (1995)</ref> which was melted 1 h at 1400°C, 1 h at 1500°C, and 6 h at 1500°C; between each fusion the glass was crushed. The glass was melted an additional 45 h at temperatures between 1490 and 1550°C followed by grinding to a fine powder. The glasses were crystal-free and homogeneous within the precision of electron microprobe analysis (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). However, the albite glass is slightly peraluminous and the orthoclase glass slightly peralkaline. Both glasses were stored in a drying oven at 110°C.</p><p>Glasses were hydrated before use in experiments XI and XII. Aliquots of anhydrous glasses were hydrated with 5.5 wt% H 2 O by melting at 1.5 GPa, 1250°C for 30 min in Pt capsules in a piston cylinder using a 1.91 cm NaCl-Pyrex-crushable alumina assembly. Water was added by microsyringe, and capsules were welded while immersed in a water bath to eliminate volatile loss during welding. Loaded capsules were stored at 110°C for a minimum of 1 h to homogenize the H 2 O. H 2 O concentrations were determined by weight loss upon ignition to 1020°C for 8 h. The H 2 O content of the hydrated orthoclase glass was 5.4 wt% and that of the hydrated albite glass was 5.6 wt%. These hydrated glasses were stored in air before use in experiments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Experimental Procedures</head><p>All anhydrous and hydrous experiments were performed using the diffusion couple technique. Diffusion couples were assembled by firmly packing the orthoclase composition into the lower half of a cylindrical graphite capsule (1 mm inside diameter ϫ 6 mm long). The top half of the capsule was filled with the albite composition and closed with a graphite lid. In order to avoid water loss, the graphite capsules with hydrated glasses were placed into platinum capsules which were welded closed in a water bath. Experiments were performed in a piston-cylinder apparatus. Experiments at 1.0 GPa utilized a 1.91 cm NaCl-glass-crushable alumina assembly <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Hudon et al., 1994)</ref>. At 1600 and 1492°C the glass was fused silica whereas at lower temperatures Pyrex was used. The experiment at 2.0 GPa utilized a 1.25 cm NaCl-Pyrex-crushable alumina assembly. For all anhydrous experiments the capsules were loaded, placed into the completed assemblies, and stored overnight at 110°C before use.</p><p>The samples were pressurized and heated simultaneously until a pressure of 0.2 GPa above the run pressure and a temperature of 150 -200°C below the temperature of interest was reached; then the pressure was slowly reduced to the experimental pressure and maintained to within 0.05 GPa of the desired pressure. The samples were heated at a rate of 300°C/min until 20°C below the experimental temperature and then heated at 50°C/min; typically the temperatures exceeded the desired run temperature by 4°C for the first 30 s of each experiment. Temperatures were measured with Type C thermocouples located within 1 mm of the middle of the capsule. Temperature gradients along the capsules were less than 15°C <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Hudon et al., 1994)</ref>.</p><p>Samples were quenched at a rate of 2000°C/min by turning off the furnace power.</p><p>Most experiments were performed between 1200 and 1600°C at 1.0 GPa. These temperatures are above the melting temperature of albite at 1.0 GPa <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Boettcher et al., 1982)</ref> and below the leucite liquidus for orthoclase composition at this pressure, 1500°C <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Lindsley, 1966)</ref>. Because the 1 atm glass transition temperature for orthoclase is 948°C <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Richet and Bottinga, 1995)</ref>, most experiments in this study measured diffusion between an equilibrium (albite) and a supercooled (orthoclase) melt. This is also the situation for the 2.0 GPa, 1400°C experiment. The 1 atm glass transition temperature for albite is 827°C <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Richet and Bottinga, 1995)</ref>. Therefore, it is probable that both orthoclase and albite compositions were glasses during the experiment at 1.0 GPa, 800°C.</p><p>The quenched samples were mounted in epoxy, sectioned longitudinally, and polished for electron microprobe analysis. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, we were able to avoid deformation in the graphite capsules, and we maintained the reservoir geometry during the diffusion experiments. Chemical analyses were made with a JEOL 8900 Superprobe with five wavelength dispersive spectrometers using 15 kV accelerating voltage, 5 nA beam current, 10 m beam diameter, with 20 s counting time on the peaks and 10 s on the backgrounds. Standards used were natural crystalline albite for Na and orthoclase for Si, Al, and K; data were reduced using the ZAF correction technique. For all but one sample, IV A, three traverses (60 -160 analysis points each) parallel to the diffusion direction were made; spacing between analytical points varied from 20 to 60 m.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Boltzmann-Matano Analysis</head><p>Diffusion coefficients, D's, were calculated from the analytical traverses for different compositions using Boltzmann-Matano analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Crank, 1975;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Baker, 1993)</ref>. To calculate the diffusivity at any concentration the following equation is solved:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">D c ϭ Ϫ 1 2t dx dC ͵ Cbkg C xdC (1)</formula><p>where D C is the diffusivity (in m 2 s Ϫ1 ) at concentration C at position x along the traverse, dx/dC is the derivative of the position respect to concentration, t is the experiment duration (in s), C bkg is the high or the low initial concentration depending on the x location with respect to the Matano interface (where x ϭ 0). To perform Boltzmann-Matano analysis, we fitted the analytical profiles with two third-order, or rarely second-order, polynomials. These polynomials can be easily integrated   and the Matano interface found. The integrations and derivations are performed to calculate the diffusivity at different points along the concentration profile. As previously demonstrated (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Crank, 1975)</ref>, Boltzmann-Matano analysis provides best results in the middle of the diffusion profile (0.5 mole fraction orthoclase in these experiments).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">RESULTS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Uncertainties and Corrections for Diffusion During Heating</head><p>Diffusion coefficients were calculated at three compositions along each diffusion profile. These compositions correspond to orthoclase mole fractions of 0.25, 0.5, and 0.75 (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>). These diffusion coefficients are the average of three traverses (with exception of experiment IV A where only two traverses were performed) and their associated standard deviations. Based upon previous studies in this laboratory the reproducibility of each diffusion measurement calculated by Boltzmann-Matano analysis is within 40% relative <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Baker and Bossa ´nyi, 1994)</ref>. Run durations in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> are the time between when the temperature was reached and when the experiment was quenched.</p><p>Alkali diffusion in melts is so rapid that significant transport may have occurred during heating of experiments to run temperatures. A zero-time experiment performed at 1600°C produced a diffusion profile 1 mm in length clearly demonstrating that diffusion was occurring during heating. To correct for any diffusion which may have occurred during heating to run temperatures, we followed the iterative technique of <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Yinnon and Cooper (1980)</ref>. This technique uses the Arrhenius relationship determined from the measured experimental temperatures, T exp , and diffusion coefficients to calculate an average temperature, T avg , for each experiment based upon the integrated diffusion occurring during the time of heating and the total duration of the experiment. This T avg is then used to recalculate a new Arrhenius relationship and the procedure for calculating T avg repeated until T avg reaches a constant value. The T avg for each experiment is given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> and all diagrams use T avg rather than T exp .</p><p>To ensure that diffusion was the only transport process involved in these experiments (e.g., no convection) two experiments were performed at T exp ϭ 1200°C for different durations, 480 and 2400 s (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> lists only the shorter run). Unfortunately diffusion of Na reached the K-rich end of the capsule in the longer experiment. Because of the nonsymmetric nature of this diffusion couple, K did not reach the end of the longer Na-rich part. The noninfinite geometry of this experiment makes strict application of Boltzmann-Matano analysis impossible. However, the estimated diffusivity in this experiment is 1 ϫ 10 Ϫ10 m 2 s Ϫ1 at X Or ϭ 0.5 which is consistent with the K diffusion coefficient at the same composition in the short experiment, 1.09 ϫ 10 Ϫ10 m 2 s Ϫ1 (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>). The consistency between the two experiments demonstrates that diffusion is the sole transport process in these experiments.</p><p>Three analytical traverses were made on most samples also to investigate the possibility of convection. One traverse was along the centre line of the capsule, and the other two were half way between the centre and the edge of the capsule. In all cases the profiles were similar to each other and similar to ideal profiles (based upon error functions); diffusion coefficients calculated from each profile were similar to each other. The shapes of the profiles and the similarity of calculated diffusivities indicate that convection did not occur and that the traverses were parallel to the diffusion path.  One of the diffusion profiles of experiment XI A is shown as an example (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a,</ref><ref type="figure">b</ref> ). As with all experiments listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> the diffusion couple is infinite, i.e., the concentrations of the diffusing species do not reach the ends of the reservoir. This condition is necessary for rigorous application of Boltzmann-Matano analysis. It can also be observed that the profile length is the same for Na and K and that the only diffusion which occurred in these experiments appears to be the exchange of these two cations (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>).</p><p>The diffusion coefficients in the anhydrous experiments vary from about 10 Ϫ9 m 2 s Ϫ1 at 1600°C (T avg ϭ 1467°C) to about 10 Ϫ12 m 2 s Ϫ1 at 800°C (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>, Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3,</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>). At the same temperature the D values are quite similar for every composition (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>) with a maximum difference of a factor of two at 800°C. Due to the small differences in diffusivity at different compositions attempts to fit the profiles with a constant diffusivity were unsuccessful. The effect of pressure is even less than the effect of composition. The experiment at 2.0 GPa, 1400°C (T avg ϭ 1331°C) yielded diffusivities within error of those measured at 1.0 GPa, 1400°C (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>). These results demonstrate that pressure does not have a measurable effect on K and Na interdiffusion in this system at T exp ϭ 1400°C (T avg ϭ 1331°C). The effect of H 2 O on Na-K interdiffusion is minor. The diffusion coefficients measured under hydrous conditions, 5.5 wt% H 2 O, are increased by only approximately a factor of four above anhydrous measurements (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>).</p><p>In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> the temperature dependence of the diffusion coefficients for 0.5 mole fraction orthoclase is displayed. Alkali diffusion can be described by the Arrhenius equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">D ϭ D o exp(ϪE a /RT) (2)</formula><p>where D o (derived from the intercept, i.e., when T is infinite) is the preexponential factor in m 2 s Ϫ1 , E a (derived from the slope of the line) is the activation energy in kJ mol Ϫ1 , R is the gas constant in Jk Ϫ1 mol Ϫ1 , and T is the temperature in kelvins. For all anhydrous experiments at 0.5 mole fraction orthoclase the Arrhenius equation for Na-K interdiffusion when T exp values are considered is D ϭ 4.03(ϩ2.8,Ϫ1.6) ϫ 10 Ϫ6 exp(Ϫ129.5 Ϯ 6.9/RT), whereas when T avg 's are used Arrhenius changes slightly to D ϭ 2.39(ϩ1.7,Ϫ0.98) ϫ 10 Ϫ5 exp(Ϫ145.8 Ϯ 6.8/RT).</p><p>Arrhenius parameters describing Na-K diffusion at other compositions along diffusion profiles, X or ϭ 0.25 or 0.75, are within error of these determined at X or ϭ 0.5. The hydrous melt Na-K diffusion results of this study have been combined with K chemical diffusion measurements in a granitic melt ϩ 6.4 wt% H 2 O determined at 450 and 560 MPa <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bai and Koster van Groos, 1994)</ref> to calculate a preliminary Arrhenius equations for K diffusion in silicic melts with 6 Ϯ 0.5 wt% H 2 O. If T exp 's are used the Arrhenius equation is D ϭ 2.49(ϩ1.9,Ϫ1.1) ϫ 10 Ϫ6 exp(Ϫ111.0 Ϯ 6.4/RT), and using T avg 's it is D ϭ 4.97(ϩ0.85,Ϫ0.73) ϫ 10 Ϫ6 exp(Ϫ115.8 Ϯ 1.8/RT).</p><p>Although the compositions used in this study and in that of <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bai and Koster van Groos (1994)</ref> are different, the effects of composition on alkali diffusion in silicic melts are expected to be minor <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Smith, 1974;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Henderson et al., 1985)</ref>. The validity of combining K diffusion measurements in granitic melt with those in alkali feldspar melts is supported by the close correspondence between the calculated Arrhenius line for K diffusion in hydrous melts and Na-K interdiffusion measurements in alkali feldspar melts ϩ1.7 wt% H 2 O <ref type="bibr">(Chekhmir and Epel'baum, 1991)</ref> which were not used in the calculation of the line (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Diffusion of Alkalis Compared to Other Elements</head><p>The Na-K interdiffusion coefficients measured in this study are orders of magnitude above those of network former interdiffusion in alkali feldspar melts. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> the Si-Al interdiffusion coefficients in alkali feldspar melts have been estimated from measured high-pressure viscosities in albite and orthoclase melts at temperatures between 1400 and 1600°C and pressures between 0.75 and 2.5 GPa <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Dingwell, 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">White and Montana, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Baker, 1996)</ref> through use of the Eyring equation (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Baker, 1990)</ref>. Additionally the orthoclase melt viscosity measurements at 2.5 GPa <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(White and Montana, 1990)</ref>   <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Dingwell, 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">White and Montana, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Baker, 1996)</ref> of albite melt (filled triangles) and orthoclase melt (filled circles) and Ca-Sr interdiffusion in albite melt (crosses) from Fujii (1981) are reported for comparison. can be used to estimate an activation energy for Si-Al diffusion of approximately 450 kJ mol Ϫ1 . These estimated Si-Al interdiffusion coefficients are four orders of magnitude below those of Na-K (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>) and the activation energy for Si-Al interdiffusion almost four times that measured for Na-K. The interdiffusion coefficients of the alkaline-earths Ca and Sr measured in albite melt by <ref type="bibr">Fujii (1981)</ref> at 1400°C and pressures of 0.25 and 2.0 GPa are approximately one decade below Na-K interdiffusion coefficients (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>). These differences between diffusion of alkalis, alkaline-earths, and network formers are not anomalous and have been observed repeatedly in diffusion studies on natural compositions (cf. review by <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Watson and Baker, 1991)</ref>.</p><p>The progressive increase in diffusion coefficients from Si-Al through Ca-Sr to Na-K in alkali feldspar melts is correlated with decreasing field strength, Z/r 2 (Z is cation charge, r is cation radius or the cation-oxygen bond length), which we prefer to express using the valence of the cation-oxygen bond. Similar correlations between tracer diffusion and cation properties have been observed previously (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Hofmann, 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Henderson et al., 1985)</ref>.</p><p>Comparison of Na-K interdiffusion in feldspar melts with Si-Al interdiffusion and Zr and P chemical diffusion in rhyolitic melts demonstrates that bond valence, or field strength, alone does not simply control diffusivity. It is the bond valence, or field strength, combined with the ability of the melt to accommodate cations in suitable charge-balanced coordination polyhedra which are instrumental in controlling rates of diffusion in highly polymerized melts such as alkali feldspar compositions. Studies of the structures of feldspar glasses demonstrate that Na and K are coordinated by oxygens associated with rings of 6 (Si,Al)-O tetrahedra which dominate the structure of the glass and most probably of isocompositional melts (see reviews by <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Mysen, 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Brown et al., 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">McMillan and Wolf, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Stebbins, 1995)</ref>. The Na-O bond length for eight-coordinated Na in albite melt is 0.235 nm; in orthoclase and albite-orthoclase glasses K is nine-to ten-fold coordinated and K-O bond lengths are between 0.3 and 0.306 nm <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Brown et al., 1995)</ref>.

Oxides of these cations have solubilities in the range of tens of weight percent which reflect the ability of the melt to accomodate these cations inside charge-balancing polyhedra of oxygen anions. The high field-strength elements Zr and P are the slowest diffusing cations in anhydrous rhyolitic melts with diffusivities of approximately 3 ϫ 10 Ϫ16 m 2 s Ϫ1 and 1 ϫ 10 Ϫ16 m 2 s Ϫ1 , respectively, at 1200°C and pressures similar to those of this study <ref type="bibr">(Harrison and</ref><ref type="bibr">Watson, 1983, 1984)</ref>.

The low diffusivity of P and Zr, particularly Zr whose charge is the same as Si but has a lower bond valence, is attributed to the difficulty of creating charge-balanced polyhedra for these cations in anhydrous rhyolitic melts due to low proportion of nonbridging oxygens in silica-rich melts. The inability of silicarich melts to create abundant charge-balanced oxygen polyhedra for Zr and P is demonstrated by the low solubilities of zircon, 2800 ppm Zr <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Harrison and Watson, 1983)</ref>, and apatite, 800 ppm P <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Harrison and Watson, 1984)</ref>, at 1200°C in rhyolitic melts. These correlations lead us to the conclusion that any future model for the prediction of cation diffusion in silicate melts must include both the bond valence of the cation-oxygen bond and some measure of the melt's ability to create chargebalancing polyhedra.</p></div>

At 1000°C and below comparison of experimental and calculated Na-K interdiffusion reveals apparently anomalous behavior. At these lower temperatures the experimental values are near to, and below, the values of K tracer diffusion in orthoclase and albite glasses which is inconsistent with Eqn. 3 and the assumption of ideal mixing of Or and Ab components in the melt or glass. The reduction in the measured Na-K interdiffusion coefficient is attributed to the probable nonideality in the melt or glass at these lower temperatures and is a manifestation of the mixed alkali effect (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Chakraborty, 1995)</ref>.</p><p>Comparison of our study with the multicomponent diffusion experiments of <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Chakraborty et al.

Despite the different physical and thermodynamic states of the system, Na-K interdiffusion appears Arrhenian at all temperatures, unlike tracer diffusion in some systems (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Chakraborty, 1995)</ref>. It is tempting to link the Arrhenian behavior of Na-K diffusion to the strong viscous behavior of albite liquid and glass <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Richet and Bottinga, 1995)</ref>. However, as discussed below, the small effect of H 2 O on Na-K interdiffusion and its large effect on viscosity and Si-Al diffusion indicate that the relationship between Na-K diffusion and viscosity is complex and beyond the scope of the present paper.</p><p>Comparison of Na-K interdiffusion in alkali feldspar melts extrapolated down to 650 and 600°C and Na-K interdiffusion in crystalline alkali feldspar <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Brady and Yund, 1983)</ref> demonstrates that diffusion in melts (or glasses) is six orders of magnitude greater than in the crystalline phase.

This behavior is related to the different local structure around alkalis and alkaline earths in aluminosilicate melts. <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Taylor and Brown (1979)</ref> found that anorthitic glass, and, therefore, presumably melt, is dominated by four-membered tetrahedral rings as in the crystalline structure of feldspars; these four-membered rings provide the charge-balanced locations for Ca cations.

The different size of these rings of tetrahedra are proposed to be responsible for the different activation volumes of alkali and alkaline earths.

Such a result is not unexpected in as much as <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Watson's (1981)</ref> study of the effects of H 2 O on Na tracer diffusion in obsidian demonstrated that H 2 O only increased diffusion by a small value. The Na-K interdiffusion coefficients increase by only a factor of four with the addition of 5.5 wt% of H 2 O. Ca-Sr interdiffusion coefficients increase by a factor of six with the addition of 4 wt% of H 2 O. However P, Zr, and Si diffusion coefficients increase by about three orders of magnitude with addition of 6 wt% of H 2 O. The strong H 2 O effect which decreases the activation energies by a factor of two for Si and Zr and by a factor of six for P is attributed to the interaction between H 2 O and bridging oxygens to form hydroxyls and nonbridging oxygens (see review by <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Watson, 1994)</ref> and results in the creation of additional charge-balanced polyhedra in silica-rich melts for these high field strength cations (see previous discussion). We observed that with addition of H 2 O the activation energy decreased by 20% and the preexponential factor for Na-K interdiffusion increased by only a factor of ten (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>). The small changes in Arrhenius parameters are attributed to the minor effect of H 2 O on the local structure, i.e., coordination polyhedra, related to Na and K in alkali feldspar melts. The observed Arrhenian behavior encourages the extrapolation of Na-K interdiffusion measurements to Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.6.">Application to Contamination Calculations</head><p>In order to evaluate the applicability of the results from this study to the description of alkali diffusion in the natural geological setting, we compared them with previous data obtained under different experimental conditions on different compositions of natural rocks (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">8</ref>). The most exhaustive study available on alkali chemical diffusion was performed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Smith (1974)</ref> who investigated the alkali diffusion in basaltic, andesitic, and rhyolitic melts at 1 atm in a temperature range from 1100 to 1550°C. Unfortunately, this study does not give any information about the effects of H 2 O and pressure on alkali diffusion. The Na-K interdiffusion coefficient was estimated for a feldspar-basalt diffusion couple <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Watson, 1982)</ref> at 1300°C, 0.6 GPa, and the K chemical diffusion was measured in an anhydrous basalt-granite couple at 1250°C, 1.0 GPa <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Watson and Jurewicz, 1984)</ref>. The only available data about the effect of H 2 O on alkali diffusion in natural rocks are from van der Laan and Wyllie (1993) who measured Na and K chemical diffusion between a basaltic and granitic melt with 5 wt% added H 2 O at 920°C, 1.0 GPa and from <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bai and Koster van Groos (1994)</ref> who measured only K chemical diffusion at low temperatures, 750 -900°C, and pressures, 100 -560 MPa, in a granitic melt ϩ 6.4 wt% H 2 O. Because the results of <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bai and Koster van Groos (1994)</ref> were used to constrain the Arrhenius line for hydrous alkali diffusion (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>), they are not shown as individual points in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">8</ref>. Comparison of previous independent measurements of alkali chemical diffusion with the Arrhenius lines calculated in this study demonstrates excellent agreement. The only significant discrepancy is with the measurement of <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Watson and Jurewicz (1984)</ref>. The low diffusion coefficient of <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Watson and Jurewicz (1984)</ref> is related to their experimental technique in which they studied the diffusion of K from a partially molten granite into a superliquidus basalt under anhydrous conditions. Under these conditions alkali diffusion is expected to be slower because diffusion of K into the basalt requires counter diffusion of Ca, Mg, and Fe which will be significantly slower than alkali interdiffusion (as argued by <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Watson and Jurewicz, 1984)</ref>. This diffusive coupling between K and other ions in the melt is a multicomponent example of diffusive coupling which has been extensively studied in simple systems (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Kress and Ghiorso, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr">Chakraborty et al., 1995a,b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Liang et al., 1997)</ref>. Theoretically, diffusive coupling can lead to uphill diffusion of any element (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Kress and Ghiorso, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr">Chakraborty et al., 1995a,b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Liang et al., 1997)</ref>, but uphill diffusion of alkalis in natural compositions has only been observed during anhydrous diffusion between dissolving quartz and basaltic melts <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Sato, 1974;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Watson 1982)</ref>. The coupling of alkali diffusion with other ions in natural melts appears to be substantially weakened when H 2 O is added. The hydrous basaltic-granitic melt interdiffusion experiments of van der Laan and Wyllie (1993) demonstrated that addition of 5 wt% H 2 O increases alkali diffusion coefficients to values consistent with those measured in this study, whereas diffusion coefficients of Ca, Mg, and Fe were much lower. Based upon the good agreement of all the studies we are confident that the Na-K interdiffusion coefficients measured in this study can be used as maximum values for petrologic investigations of alkali diffusion in a wide range of natural melt compositions. We estimate that these values are accurate within approximately one-half an order of magnitude for most compositions ranging from basaltic to rhyolitic melts (cf. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">8</ref>). However, it should be noted that in some natural circumstances, such as the dissolution of quartz discussed above, diffusive coupling may lead to uphill diffusion which cannot be predicted from the results of this study. The observed Arrhenian behavior of Na-K interdiffusion suggests that measurements can be extrapolated to lower temperatures equivalent to those of pegmatite genesis, near 600°C. Moreover, due to the insignificant effects of H 2 O and pressure observed in this study on alkali diffusion, we also theorize that these diffusion coefficients are applicable for the calculation of alkali diffusive transport and contamination of melts of a wide range of temperatures, pressures, and H 2 O concentrations which may be found in crustal and upper mantle melts.</p></div>
