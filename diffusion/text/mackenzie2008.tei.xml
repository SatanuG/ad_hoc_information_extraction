<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The volatilization of Cd, Re, Tl, Pb, Sb and Te from melts in the system CaO-MgO-Al 2 O 3 -SiO 2 (CMAS) and Na 2 O-MgO-Al 2 O 3 -SiO 2 (NMAS) has been investigated at 0.1 MPa and 1200-1350 °C. Experiments were conducted in air using metal-doped melts in Pt crucibles. Analysis of quenched glasses by Laser Ablation Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) normal to the melt/gas interface produced concentration profiles for Cd, Re, Tl, Pb, Sb and Te to which a semi-infinite one-dimensional diffusion model could be applied to extract diffusion coefficients (D). The melt was also doped with Cu, Zn, In, Mo, Sn and W but concentration profiles for these metals did not develop. In the CMAS composition at 1300 °C, the fastest diffusing element was Cd having a logD Cd = -6.5 ± 0.2. The slowest element was Re with logD Re = -7.5 ± 0.3. Diffusivities of Sb, Te, Pb and Tl have intermediate values where logD Sb = -7.1 ± 0.1, logD Te = -7.2 ± 0.3, logD Pb = -7.1 ± 0.2, logD Tl = -7.0 ± 0.2 cm 2 /s. In the NMAS composition, logD Re = -6.5 ± 0.2, logD Sb = -6.0 ± 0.2, logD Pb = -6.1 ± 0.1, logD Tl = -5.8 ± 0.2 cm 2 /s (values for Cd and Te were not determined). Differences in diffusivity of volatile heavy metal ions to a melt-gas interface lead to significant fractionation between these metals in magmas during degassing. Given the observed differences in Cd and Re diffusivities in the CMAS composition, we predict an increase in the normalized Cd/Re ratio in the gas phase with increasing bubble growth rate. Monitoring of the Cd/Re ratios in aerosols from degassing volcanoes may provide a tool for predicting volcanic eruption.</p></div>

For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Nriagu (1989)</ref> has estimated that volcanic emanations may account for as much as 40-50% of the global flux of Cd and Hg into the environment, and 20-40% of other volatile metals <ref type="bibr">(As, Cu, Ni, Pb and Sb)</ref>. The recognition and quantification of element transport and flux from volcanoes has relied principally on empirical measurements from plumes (and related fumaroles and condensates) during eruptions and on studies of melt inclusions <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Wallace, 2005)</ref> and natural glasses <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Norman et al., 2004)</ref>.</p><p>While traditionally aqueous fluids have been thought of as the principal transport agent of many important metals <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Williams-Jones et al., 2002)</ref>, the transport of metals by vapour has received renewed attention as a potentially important mechanism in the formation of ore deposits <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Williams-Jones and Heinrich, 2005)</ref>. Monitoring of volcanic gases also has some utility in understanding degassing processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Miller et al., 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Villemant and Boudon, 1999)</ref> or to predict volcanic eruption <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Aiuppa et al., 2007)</ref> and the potential duration of volcanic events <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Pennisi and Le Cloarec, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Aiuppa et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Alletti et al., 2007)</ref>. Finally, it has been suggested that monitoring trace metal ratios in volcanic fumes from inactive vents could provide a tool for predicting volcanic eruption <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Crowe et al., 1987)</ref>.</p><p>Despite the importance of volcanic degassing to global trace metal inventories and ore genesis, our current understanding of the underlying factors that control the transport of these metals remains in infancy. As a natural system, volcanic eruptions and the resulting metal release are a complex, transient phenomenon that is difficult, dangerous, and expensive to measure. It would be beneficial to have complementary experimental constraints on the fundamentals for element mobility, speciation and partitioning to help understand the process, quantity and flux expected for volatile metals liberated during an eruption.</p><p>Emanation coefficients (ɛ x ), which are a measure of the changes in metal concentration of magma as a result of eruption, can be used as a proxy for element volatility in magmas. The emanation coefficient of an element (x) from lava is defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">e x ¼ C i À C f ð Þ =C f<label>ð1Þ</label></formula><p>where C i and C f are the concentration in the initial lava and after eruption respectively. Enrichment factors (EF) have also been used to describe element volatility where the enrichment factor of an element (x) is related to the aerosol and lava concentrations C x normalized to a single element C norm :</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">EF x ¼ C x =C norm ð Þ aerosol = C x =C norm ð Þ lava<label>ð2Þ</label></formula><p>where C x is the concentration of element (x) and C norm is the concentration of an element used to normalize the concentrations in the aerosol and lava. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Rubin (1997)</ref> compiled volatile emission data for many metals from several basaltic to andesitic volcanoes and calculated their mean ɛ x . The calculated values indicate a non-uniform distribution of volatile metals in volcanic gases (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>). Calculated EF's (i.e. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Hinkley et al., 1994)</ref> show a similar trend where chalcophile metals such as Cd and Cu are variably enriched in volcanic plumes. In spite of these empirical observations, the root causes of differences in element enrichment remain unconstrained. Variations in a metals ɛ x and EF may be attributed to intrinsic differences in the concentrations of volatile species in the melt, or to refreshment of volatile metals through pulses of new (undegassed) magma <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Hinkley et al., 1994)</ref>. Values of ɛ x may also vary according to the ability of a metal to form a volatile species with O, S or halogens <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(LeGuern, 1988)</ref>. Alternatively, different values of ɛ x among metals may also depend on an element having variable mobility to migrate and reach a melt/gas interface prior to forming a volatile complex and partitioning into the gas phase during degassing.</p><p>Volatile depletion and vapour transport of metals in silicate liquids requires: 1) the exsolution of volatile species from the melt during depressurization and formation of gas bubbles, 2) the diffusion of metal to a melt/gas interface (bubble) and 3) the partitioning of a metal species into the bubble followed by release of this gas.</p><p>Melt viscosity, oxidation state and the degree of volatile supersaturation are all factors potentially affecting all these processes. Kinetic processes such as diffusion, likely dominate magma degassing in an open system characterized by disequilibrium fractional distillation. In a closed system under equilibrium, however, partition-ing of metals into the gas phase likely controls volatile metal release during magma degassing. Oxide, hydroxide, chloride and sulphide complexation likely also play an important role in metal transport in volcanic gases. Given that diffusivity, partitioning and complexation are all factors in the ultimate release of volatile metals from magma, our study seeks to address the first stage of these processes by measuring the mobility of several volatile metals toward a melt-gas interface in simple silicate melts analogous to natural basaltic magmas. The data is then modeled and compared with empirical measurements of natural samples to establish any correlations between metal mobility and concentrations in naturally degassing volcanoes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Experimental methods</head><p>The mobility of an element in melts is controlled by its diffusivity, which is dependent on melt composition, temperature and speciation in the melt. To measure diffusion rates of volatile heavy metals, we used metal-doped melts in contact with a gas phase. The technique exploits the volatility of an element to establish a concentration gradient where metals in the melt must equilibrate with the atmosphere above it <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(MacKenzie and Canil, 2006)</ref>. The concentration gradients resulting from volatilization were measured to determine the chemical diffusivity of metals in melts at different temperatures.</p><p>A synthetic, CaO-MgO-Al 2 O 3 -SiO 2 (CMAS "haplobasalt") composition corresponding to the Di 58 -An 42 eutectic and a Na 2 O-MgO-Al 2 O 3 -SiO 2 (NMAS) were used as starting materials (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). The phase relations in the CMAS system are well studied and CMAS is a good analog for natural basaltic compositions <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Presnall et al., 2002)</ref>. We chose to use the NMAS composition to evaluate the effects of changing melt composition on metal diffusivity because NMAS melts have lower viscosity relative to CMAS thus, our experimental times did not have to be extended.</p><p>To prepare starting materials, reagent grade SiO 2 , Al 2 O 3 , MgO and/or Na 2 CO 3 /CaCO 3 powders were ground under alcohol in an agate mortar and dried at 120 °C in air for 1 h. Once dried, the mixture was decarbonated at 1000 °C for 3 h and then fused at 1500 °C in a 25 mm diameter Pt crucible for 4 h prior to quenching to a glass. The glass was crushed and ground to a powder to which 1000 ppm NIST certified standard solutions of different metals (Cd, Re, Pb, Cu, Te, Zn, Tl, In, Mo, Sn, Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>. Summary of (log) average ɛ x for mafic volcanic eruptions worldwide (data from <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Rubin, 1997)</ref>. Mean standard deviations shown at 1σ. Sb, W and Yb) were added using a micropipette. The powder and solution were subsequently ground under alcohol for 10 min to homogenize the mixture. After drying under a heat lamp, the mixture was again fused in air at 1500 °C for 6 h prior to quenching to a glass. Quenched glasses were crushed, re-ground and re-melted twice to homogenize the mixture. Analyses of random chips of starting glasses indicate homogeneity in their major and trace element compositions (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</p><p>Powdered starting glass was loaded into 10 mm long × 2 mm ID diameter Pt crucibles. The crucible was held in a 3 × 3 × 2 cm ceramic carrier and placed in the pre-heated box furnace. Temperature was measured using a type S (Pt/Pt 90 Rh 10 ) thermocouple immediately above the crucible and controlled to within ±1 °C. Experimental duration was between 1 and 24 h and runs were quenched by removal from the furnace and cooling in a stream of dry air (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>). After each experiment, the charges, composed entirely of quenched glass, were sectioned axially into two pieces. One half was mounted in epoxy, polished and examined in reflected light.</p><p>Convection may complicate the transport of diffusing species in diffusion experiments. The Rayleigh number calculated for a melt in our experimental arrangement is less than 10 assuming planar geometry, a thickness of 1 cm and boundary conditions of ΔT (max) = 3 °C, which is very low and does not predict convection <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Philpotts, 1990)</ref>. Furthermore, melt convection would distort the shapes of concentration distance profiles, which we do not observe. The lack of a convective driving force, low Rayleigh number and consistency of concentration distance profiles indicate that convection is negligible in our experimental design.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Analytical</head><p>Major and minor elements in experimental glasses were determined using a CAMECA SX50 electron microprobe at the University of British Columbia at 15 kV acceleration voltage and beam current of 20 nA, with peak counting times of 30 s for Mg, Al, Si and Ca. For analysis of Na in the NMAS composition, the conditions were optimized to reduce Na loss requiring a beam current of 5 nA, 10 kV acceleration voltage and a 15 s count time. Major element profiles were collected perpendicular and parallel to the melt/gas interface, and adjacent to the capsule walls and were homogenous throughout the entire charge.</p><p>Line profiles of trace element concentrations were collected perpendicular to the melt/gas interface (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>) by LA-ICP-MS at the University of Victoria using a Thermo-Instruments X-series II ICP-MS. Laser ablation was conducted using a New Wave Research, solid-state, 213 nm Nd:YAG UV laser pulsed at a frequency of 20 Hz with an energy of ∼1.9 mJ. NIST 610 and 613 Standard Reference Materials (SRM) glasses were both used as standards for all metals. The spot size and line scan traverse rate were 20 μm and 5 μm/s, respectively. Data was collected in peak jumping mode with a dwell time of 10 ms at one point per peak. 43 Ca was used as the internal standard for NIST SRM and experimental run products. Data was recorded as time-resolved spectra in counts per second, collected over 360 s with 50 s allotted to collecting background concentrations. The spectra were then subdivided into 50 time slices, each representing ∼ 30 μm of scan length and each time slice reduced to average concentrations using the Thermo© data reduction software.</p><p>Analysis of separate parallel profiles (perpendicular to the melt/gas interface) near the center and crucible walls showed no difference in  the profile shape or location <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(MacKenzie and Canil, 2006)</ref>. We conducted similar line scans ∼ 5 mm from the interface across the charge into the Pt crucible walls and observed no change in metal concentrations within the glass at or near this boundary.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Data reduction</head><p>In our experimental design, the sample is treated as a onedimensional, semi-infinite medium <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Chakraborty, 1995)</ref>. We assume the release of a volatile metal from the silicate liquid is limited by its diffusivity (D x ) to the melt/gas interface, where the metal is immediately volatilized as an oxide (i.e. in air). Differences in metal diffusivity are reflected in the curvature of the concentration profile with distance from the interface as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>. As expected, nonvolatile elements (i.e. Yb) show no change in concentration.</p><p>The equation relating the diffusion coefficient (D), distance from the interface (x) and time (t) for diffusion in a one-dimensional, semiinfinite medium <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Crank, 1975)</ref> is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">x= 2 ffiffiffiffiffi ffi Dt p ¼ erf À1 C À C s =C o À C s ð Þ ð<label>3Þ</label></formula><p>where erf -1 is the inverse error function, C is the concentration at distance (x), C o is the initial concentration and C s is the concentration at the surface. Plots of erf -1 (C -C s / C o -C s ) versus the distance (x) from the melt/gas interface yield straight lines with slopes equal to 1=2 ffiffiffiffiffi ffi Dt p , from which D can be derived (i.e. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">MacKenzie and Canil, 2006)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Results</head><p>The experimental results are summarized in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> and plotted versus inverse temperature in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref> for the CMAS composition. logD varies linearly with inverse temperature and can be fitted to Arrhenius equations of the form:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">logD ¼ logD o À E a =2:303RT<label>ð4Þ</label></formula><p>where D is the diffusivity at temperature T (K). D o is the frequency factor, R is the gas constant and E a is the activation energy. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> summarizes the calculated D o and E a values for each element in both compositions. Diffusion profiles only developed for Re, Sb, Cd, Te, Tl, and Pb even though the melts were doped with other "volatile" metals (Cu, Zn, In, Mo, Sn and W). In the CMAS composition, the diffusivity of Re, Sb, Te, Tl, and Pb at 1300 °C are similar and, on average, range from logD Tl = -7.0 ± 0.2 to logD Re = -7.5 ± 0.2 cm 2 /s. The result for logD Re is identical to previous work in the CMAS composition of <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">MacKenzie and Canil (2006)</ref> (logD Re = -7.5 ± 0.1 cm 2 /s). The diffusivities of Re, Sb, Te, Tl, and Pb show no correlation with atomic radius or charge of the atoms in their most common oxidation states. At 1300 °C, Cd is distinct having a logD Cd = -6.5 ± 0.2 cm 2 /s nearly an order of magnitude faster than Re, Sb, Te, Tl, and Pb. Diffusion rates vary linearly with inverse temperature for all elements for which D could be derived.</p><p>In the NMAS composition, Cd was completely volatized away during synthesis of the starting material and thus we were not able to calculate D Cd NMAS . The loss of Cd from the starting material can be explained by the very fast diffusion rate determined (based on the CMAS composition) coupled with the increased temperature (1500 °C) used during synthesis of the starting material. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">MacKenzie and Canil (2006)</ref> showed that diffusivity of Re, is most strongly influenced by melt composition and weakly affected by ambient oxygen fugacity. The diffusivities of Re, Sb, Tl and Pb in the NMAS composition are increased by approximately an order of magnitude compared to their CMAS values. While the diffusivities are broadly similar among Re, Sb, Tl and Pb, Re remains the slowest diffusing element with an average logD Re = -6.5 ± 0.2 cm 2 /s and Tl the fastest having an average logD Tl = -5.8 ± 0.2 at 1300 °C. The increase in diffusivity between CMAS and NMAS compositions reflects the large difference in calculated melt viscosity (logη CMAS = 2.77, logη NMAS = 2.02 Pa-s). Elements are therefore able to diffuse more rapidly out of a less viscous melt, in agreement with previous findings (MacKenzie and Canil, 2006).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Discussion</head><p>In addition to the elements noted above, the starting materials were also doped with Cu, Zn, In, Mo, Sn and W but diffusion profiles for these elements were not observed. Because the experiments were performed in air, this observation could indicate that Re, Sb, Cd, Te, Tl, and Pb formed volatile oxides whereas Cu, Zn, In, Mo, Sn and W did not. If diffusion rates for Cu, Zn, In, Mo, Sn and W were very fast, similar to Cd in the NMAS composition, it could be argued that diffusion profiles may not have been preserved. In this case, there would be an overall reduction in the concentration of Cu, Zn, In, Mo, Sn and W compared to the starting material, but this was not observed. In natural systems, Cu, Zn, In, Mo, Sn and W may volatilize from magma as complex chloride and/or sulphide species, whereas Re, Sb, Cd, Te, Tl, and Pb may also volatilize as a Cl-or S-complex, oxides or hydroxides.</p><p>Tellurium was present in the NMAS starting material but diffusion profiles were not observed, unlike in the CMAS composition. Clearly, Te forms volatile oxides reflected by development of diffusion profiles in the CMAS composition. Tellurium may form salts with Na as Na 2 Te (x) that are readily oxidized in air <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Wells, 1984)</ref> explaining the absence of a diffusion profile for this element in the NMAS composition. Because there is no suitable laser standard for Te, we cannot determine the absolute concentration in the melts. For this reason, we cannot determine if Te was lost as fast diffusing Na 2 Te (x) resulting in overall Te reduction in the charge relative to the starting material or if Te remained in the melt as a Na 2 Te (x) salt.</p><p>Studies of volatile diffusion in basaltic melts have focused largely on the most abundant volatiles such as H 2 O, CO 2 and SO 2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Watson et al., 1982;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Zhang and Stolper, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Watson et al., 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Baker and Rutherford, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Carroll and Blank, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Pineau et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Winther et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Morizet et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Freda et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Nowak et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Freda et al., 2005)</ref> and the halogens (Cl, F, Br and I) <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Dingwell and Scarfe, 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Dingwell and Mysen, 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Watson, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Métrich and Rutherford, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bai and Koster van Groos, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Lange, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Webster et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Bureau et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Signorelli and Carroll, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Webster and De Vivo, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Bureau and Metrich 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Aiuppa and Federico, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Botcharnikov et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Giordano et al., 2004)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Application</head><p>In our study, we used a simplified basalt composition and the gas phase was dry air, thus metals volatilized from the melt as simple oxides. In real volcanic systems, metals are diffusing toward a hydrous Cl-and S-rich magmatic gas and the composition of the melt is more complex containing H 2 O, CO 2 , Cl and S among other components.</p><p>The effects of additional components in the melt act to change the melt structure. Specifically, increasing H 2 O depolymerizes the melt and reduces melt viscosity <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Lange, 1994)</ref>. While the role of H 2 O on the diffusivities of volatile metals in melts remains unconstrained, Cl and S diffusivities increase with increasing H 2 O contents <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Watson, 1994)</ref>.</p><p>Our NMAS composition has a lower melt viscosity than our CMAS composition. The diffusivity of all metals studied increased in the NMAS composition. More importantly, the differences in metal diffusivity (e.g. between Tl and Re) in both compositions remained constant (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>). Consequently, the application of our data, which employs differences in relative metal diffusivity, is not discounted by differences between our simple melt compositions and melts found in nature.</p><p>Our calculated diffusivities are chemical diffusivities that reflect a metals affinity for the gaseous state as an oxide species. We recognize D values may be different if the composition of the gas phase was more similar to a natural magmatic gas as the chemical driving force is likely to be different. Problematically, natural gas compositions, which are constantly changing, are not easily replicated in experiment. However, as a first order approximation, our data likely represent minimum values and cannot address the effects of a metals variable affinities and changing gas compositions for which little is known.</p><p>The diffusivities of major volatiles (H 2 O, CO 2 ) are one of the most important processes affecting magma vesiculation and bubble growth <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Sparks et al., 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Sparks, 2003)</ref>. Trace metal diffusivities strongly influence the metal content of bubbles and ultimately, volcanic exhalants. The differences in diffusivities of metals can lead to significant fractionation of these metals during magma degassing.</p><p>We attempt to model this fractionation with our diffusion data and assumptions about partition coefficients between melt and gas (k), temperature and bubble growth rates. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Smith et al. (1955)</ref> derived a one-dimensional model that accounts for the relationship between diffusion, partitioning and bubble growth rates:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">C b r ð Þ ¼ 1 2k C 0 1 þ erf ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi ffi R=D ð Þr 2 r ! þ 2k À 1 ð Þ e Àkq R=D ð Þ r erf c 2k À 1 ð Þ ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi ffi R=D ð Þr p 2 !

C 0 is the initial concentration in the melt, R is the growth rate, D is the diffusion rate, k is the partition coefficient and q is equal to 1k.</p><p>Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">5</ref>) then can be used to derive the bubble rim composition under different model conditions which we present as instantaneous concentrations of the bubble.</p><p>Our study provides the only measurements of diffusion coefficients of Re, Cd, Te, Tl, Pb and Sb in CMAS and NMAS compositions. The major volatiles H 2 O and CO 2 have diffusivities that are orders of magnitude greater than these trace metals. Thus our modeling will assume the concentration of H 2 O and CO 2 in the bubbles is constant. As an example, we restrict our model to comparison between Cd and Re as the latter metal has a D value similar to Tl, Pb, Sb and Te. The modeling uses average D values for Re and Cd at 1300 °C for the CMAS composition listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>.</p><p>The effect of changing bubble growth rate on bubble concentration is illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref> showing the calculated concentrations (C b / C 0 ) for Cd and Re as the bubble radius increases. At the slowest growth rate (10 -6 cm/s), Cd and Re have similar concentrations in the bubble at the inception of the bubble (i.e. nucleation r = 10 -9 cm) and fractionate little from one another up to a radius of 10 -3 cm. Over this interval, (C b / C 0 Cd / C b / C 0 Re ) (hereafter referred to as Cd/Re) increases from 1.01 to 2.36 as Cd becomes modestly enriched in the bubble relative to Re. At the fastest bubble growth rate (10 -4 cm/s), (Cd/Re) increases more rapidly as a function of increasing radius. Overall at both growth rates, the (Cd/Re) ratio changes exponentially with   <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>).</p><p>increasing bubble radius. The position of the curve however is shifted to smaller radii at the fastest bubble growth rate.</p><p>As temperature decreases in an ascending magma, the diffusivities of Re and Cd also decrease but not at the same rate (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>). The effect of decreasing temperature therefore is to enhance the fractionation of Re and Cd leading to an increase the ratio (Cd/Re) with decreasing temperature.</p><p>During the ascent of magma, bubble growth is governed by the decompression rate in addition to viscous deformation and diffusion <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Lensky et al., 2004)</ref>. The increase in (Cd/Re) with increasing growth rate indicates that volcanic gases released from rapidly ascending magmas should be more enriched in Cd relative to Re compared to magmas that ascend more slowly. Data from volcanic episodes of Kilauea support this contention. Relative to Re, Cd is enriched in volcanic gases in active vents during eruption at times when magma must be ascending more rapidly compared to cooling vents when the magma is rising more slowly or is perhaps stagnant <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Crowe et al., 1987)</ref>. Furthermore, the higher cooling rate of active vents relative to cooling vents also promotes Cd enrichment over Re in the active vents, which is also consistent with the observations of <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Crowe et al. (1987)</ref>.</p><p>Currently, there are no high temperature measurements of partition coefficients between melt and gas (k) for Re, Cd, Pb, Tl, Sb and Te and thus we can only estimate the effects of changing k values within the model. The relationship between the concentration of Re and Cd in a growing bubble as a function of (k) is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>. As a minimum, k must be greater than one to explain the enrichments of these elements in volcanic gases <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Crowe et al., 1987)</ref> and their depletions in melt <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Norman et al., 2004)</ref>. Using a value for k of 1.1, Cd and Re concentrations in the bubble remain at unity until the very largest bubble radius is achieved upon which (Cd/Re) only increases to 1.4. This calculation indicates that differences in diffusion rates of Re and Cd may be unimportant if the partition coefficient is near unity.</p><p>Alternatively using k values of 15 and 100, (Cd/Re) increases in an exponential fashion. At k = 100, (Cd/Re) increases dramatically at a radius of 10 -5 cm whereas using a k value of 15, a similar increase is not achieved until the bubble radius is 10 -4 cm. Using a k value of 8 (similar to Cl at 1250 °C, k = 8.7 <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Alletti et al., 2006)</ref>), (Cd/Re) increases more gradually reaching 12.3 at a bubble radius of 10 -2 cm. As an endmember example, we used different k values to see if changes in k could offset any diffusion induced fractionation and Cd/Re ratio in the gas. Using k Re = 100 and k Cd = 2, our modeling still showed an increasing Cd/Re ratio with increasing bubble radii.</p><p>This analysis shows that diffusion rates can play a significant role in controlling the concentration of Cd and Re in growing bubbles in magma at k values N 8. Specifically Cd and Re will fractionate at smaller bubble sizes with increasing k values. The magnitude of Cd/Re fractionation at k values of 15 and 100 is similar but fractionation will occur earlier in the latter. At a k value of 8, fractionation is reduced.</p><p>Results from the above model indicate the following regarding diffusional fractionation between Cd and Re (and other metals having a similar D value as Re): 1) Cd and Re fractionation in the gas phase increases in fast ascending magmas experiencing increased bubble Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>. Change in Re and Cd concentration in bubbles as a function of increasing radius using k values of 1.1, 8, 15 and 100. As k increases, the bubble becomes more enriched in Cd relative to Re at progressively smaller bubble sizes. The curves are calculated using Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">5</ref>) where at 1300 °C, logD Re = -7.5 and logD Cd = -6.5 cm 2 /s and the bubble growth rate is 10 -5 cm/s.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Crowe et al., 1987)</ref>. Sample numbers correspond to the year sampled and sample number. Dashed line marks an eruption of lava and the filling of vents. Seep/cool vents were sampled from volcanic vents during quiescent degassing whereas active vent samples are from vents following eruption. Note the increase in Cd/Re ratio prior to and after eruption. growth rates, 2) Cd and Re fractionation in the gas phase increases in magmas that cool faster, as may be the case with newly replenished magma because of increased ΔT between the magma and chamber walls, and 3) k values between 100 and 15 have little effect on the magnitude of Cd/Re fractionation in the gas but greatly affect the time when this fractionation occurs; at k = 8 Cd and Re fractionation is reduced and at k = 1.1, there is very little fractionation.</p><p>We suggest that Cd/Re ratios in volcanic gases will increase immediately when new magma rises in the conduit or vent and subsequently degases. The magnitude of change of the Cd/Re ratio is affected by bubble growth rate, temperature and partitioning but the ratio will most certainly rise. Given this, it may be possible to predict an approaching volcanic eruption by measuring the Cd/Re ratio of volcanic gases as originally suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Crowe et al. (1987)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Alletti et al. (2007)</ref> have suggested, using a similar model that S/F, Br/F and Cl/F should decrease when new magma rises in the conduit or vent and degasses and that these ratios may also be useful in predicting eruption.</p><p>In our model, Cd/Re in volcanic gases should increase during preeruptive degassing and after eruption as new (undegassed) magma rises and bubbles grow and are released. There is empirical support for our result. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">8</ref> shows the Cd/Re ratio of gases released from Kilauea over an eruption cycle from early November 1983 to late January 1984 that includes quiescent degassing to active eruption <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Crowe et al., 1987)</ref>. The exact time interval between each sample number in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">8</ref> was not reported but we assumed the samples were taken at equal intervals (∼ 7 days).</p><p>Prior to eruption, the Cd/Re ratio in gases is low (5.8 ± 2.1) but nearer to eruption, at sample time 83-6, this ratio more than doubles to 18.8 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">8</ref>). Immediately prior to eruption, the ratio drops back to the baseline level then increases abruptly to 54.9 ± 4.6 after eruption and this value is maintained during the remaining period. The changes in Cd/Re throughout an eruption cycle at Kilauea support our model and hypothesis that monitoring Cd/Re may provide a good indication of impending eruption. We note that Cd/Sb also increases prior to eruption which is predicted in our model given the slower diffusivities of Re and Sb relative to Cd. Changes in Br/F, S/F, Cl/F throughout the eruptive cycle at Kilauea are also consistent with the model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Alletti et al. (2007)</ref> suggesting a decrease in these ratios prior to eruption. Ideally, monitoring all these ratios in volcanic exhalants would add confidence to predictions of volcanic eruptions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.">Summary</head><p>Volatilization experiments of trace metals, Cd, Re, Pb, Tl, Sb and Te were performed in CMAS and NMAS melts at 0.1 MPa and temperatures between 1200 and 1350 °C. Concentration profiles developed as a result of volatilization were measured to provide estimates of metal diffusivity. Although Cu, Zn, In, Mo, Sn and W were also added to the experiments, concentration profiles did not develop indicating these elements do not form volatile oxides above the melt. The diffusion data was modeled to estimate diffusional fractionation as functions of bubble growth rates, temperature and partitioning. Our model shows that differences in diffusion rates will cause elements to fractionate from one another during magma degassing. Cd/Re ratios should increase during preeruptive degassing and remain high throughout the eruption. This result is demonstrated in natural samples providing a compelling method for development in efforts to forecast impending volcanic activity.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 2 .</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Fig. 2.
