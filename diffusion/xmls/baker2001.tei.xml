<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Granitic and rhyolitic magma systems generally contain a rich assemblage of accessory minerals such as zircon, apatite, titanite, monazite and allanite that control the abundance of rare earth elements (REE) and high field strength elements (HFSE). Numerous studies, both classic (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Hanson 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Fourcade and Allegre 1981;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Miller and Mittlefehldt 1982;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Mittlefehldt and Miller 1983)</ref> and recent (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Hoskin et al. 2000)</ref>, have shown that minute quantities of such accessory minerals often contain most of the HFSE in felsic rocks. Previous studies on the dissolution of zircon, apatite and monazite and on the diffusion of their essential struc-tural components in felsic melts constrain the effect of these minerals on the trace element chemistry of hydrous granitic melts <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Watson 1979</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Watson , 1980;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Watson and Capobianco 1981;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Watson and Green 1981;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Green and Watson 1982;</ref><ref type="bibr">Harrison and</ref><ref type="bibr">Watson 1983, 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Watson and Harrison 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Rapp and Watson 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Keppler 1993)</ref>.</p><p>Among accessories, zircon has been of major interest to geochemists because it is a major sink of Zr, Hf, Th, Ta and REE in granites and because of its role in U-Pb geochronology (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Pidgeon et al. 1996</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Pidgeon et al. , 1998;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Nasdala et al. 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Eichorn et al. 2000)</ref>. Several experimental studies have investigated zircon solubility and dissolution rate in natural and synthetic silicate melts <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Larsen 1973;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Watson 1979;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Watson and Harrison 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Keppler 1993)</ref>. These studies provide information on zircon crystallization in magmatic systems and on its tendency to survive or to be consumed during crustal melting events. The extremely low solubility of zircon in hydrous metaluminous and peraluminous granitic melts ($100 ppm at 750 °C) lead <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Watson and Harrison (1983)</ref> to conclude that solid state diffusion is responsible for the reallocation of trace elements between zircon and melt, and that Zr diffusion in felsic melts is the ratelimiting step for the dissolution of zircons. In their companion study, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Harrison and Watson (1983)</ref> investigated the role of variable water content on the kinetics of zircon dissolution in felsic systems. Remarkable contrasts arise between wet and dry behaviour. The first 2 wt% H 2 O introduced in the felsic melt is critical because it increases the zirconium diffusivity at 1,200 °C by a factor of 100 and doubles its solubility; this indicates that with respect to dry conditions dissolution proceeds geologically instantaneously in water-bearing, but undersaturated, felsic melts.</p><p>A critical factor in trace element models for HFSE and REE in granite petrogenesis may be the role played by halogens. The influence of halogens on HFSE and REE concentrations during granite petrogenesis has been suggested because of the observed correlation between HFSE and halogen contents <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Pichavant et al. 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Pollard et al. 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Congdon and Nash 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr">S ˇtemprok 1991)</ref>. Although transport of HFSE via formation of fluorine complexes in an aqueous fluid phase has been hypothesized, this process has not been supported by experimental evidence for many HFSE <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(London 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Keppler and</ref><ref type="bibr">Wyllie 1990, 1991)</ref>. It has been suggested, however, that the formation of fluorine complexes in the melt could drastically change the fractionation behaviour of HFSE between melt and crystals, thus resulting in a correlation between fluorine and HFSE <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Raimbault et al. 1987)</ref>. Although analyses of granitic rocks for both halogens and zirconium are rare, examination of 120 analyses of granites and rhyolites demonstrates that the rocks most enriched in Zr are also substantially enriched in either F or Cl <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Hildreth 1981;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Mutschler et al. 1981;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Conrad 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Hildreth et al. 1984</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Hildreth et al. , 1991;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Rytuba and McKee 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Hervig and Dunbar 1992)</ref>. Notably, many Zr-enriched silicic rocks, those with more than approximately 200 ppm Zr, are peralkaline.</p><p>The effect of F on zircon solubility in felsic melts was investigated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Keppler (1993)</ref> who found a strongly non-linear solubility in a water-saturated haplogranitic melt containing 0-6 wt% F, qualitatively consistent with the trends seen in natural rocks. In agreement with <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Watson (1979)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Watson and Harrison (1983)</ref>, Keppler demonstrated that the solubility of zircon is extremely low in hydrous, metaluminous silicic melts and in melts with 2 wt%, or less, F at 800 °C, 200 MPa.</p><p>This paper reports an experimental investigation of zircon solubility and Zr diffusion in metaluminous felsic melts containing between 0.4 and 5.1 wt% H 2 O and amounts of F (1.2 wt%) and Cl (0.35 wt%) typical of F-and Cl-enriched natural metaluminous felsic rocks <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Pichavant et al. 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Congdon and Nash 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr">S ˇtemprok 1991)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental techniques</head><p>Zircon solubility and Zr diffusion were determined using the zircon dissolution technique pioneered by <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Harrison and Watson (1983)</ref>. Diffusion/dissolution experiments contained zircon, one of three felsic glass compositions (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>) and water. The first glass was the same metaluminous rhyolitic obsidian (LCO) used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Harrison and Watson (1983)</ref>. The second was a chlorine-containing mix (LCl, 0.35 wt% Cl) obtained by combining LCO with PtCl 4 (1.26 wt%), and the third was rhyolitic glass (MRF) containing 1.2 wt% fluorine synthesized by <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Baker and Vaillancourt (1995)</ref>. Based upon experiments performed in this laboratory and by <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Webster (1992)</ref>, the chlorine concentration in LCl is close to the value at which a metaluminous melt with 6 wt% H 2 O saturates in a second phase (either molten hydrous chloride or a Cl-bearing hydrous fluid). This chlorine concentration far exceeds that measured in most granitic and rhyolitic rocks. Because of the high partition coefficient of Cl between fluid and melt <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Carroll and Webster 1994)</ref> we cannot be certain of the pre-eruptive Cl concentrations, but we can presume they did not exceed the Cl solubility in the melt. The fluorine concentration in MRF is far below the maximum solubility of F in a metaluminous granitic melt <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Carroll and Webster 1994)</ref>; however, it is significantly above the F concentration analysed in most granitic and rhyolitic rocks <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Carroll and Webster 1994)</ref>.</p><p>Two additional melt compositions were synthesized by doping LCO with ZrO 2 (LCOZr) or ZrO 2 + Fe 2 O 3 (LCOZrFe). These compositions were synthesized in order to perform reversals of the dissolution experiments by the crystallization of zircon. Each mix was ground under ethanol for 30 min then melted twice, with intermediate grinding, at 1,500 °C for 4 h each time. Both starting materials contained glass with a small amount, less than $10% by volume, of crystals whose maximum size was below 6 lm in the longest dimension. Microprobe analysis demonstrated that the glassy portions of these mixes were homogeneous and the crystals were a mixture of residual zirconia and zircon. The Zr concentration in the glassy portion of LCOZr was 19,000±660 ppm. The glassy portion of LCOZrFe contained 4.55±0.10 wt% FeO* (total iron analysed as FeO) and 18,000±490 ppm Zr. No alkali loss occurred in these compositions during their synthesis. These two starting materials glasses were ground under ethanol to a grain size below 50 lm and stored in a drying oven at 110 °C.</p><p>Zircon crystals from the Mud Tank Carbonatite, Harte Range, Australia (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Harrison and Watson 1983)</ref>, obtained from Wards Scientific, were cut in 1-3-mm slabs and used in early experiments. Additional crystals of zircon from Colonia, Sri Lanka, purchased from Hawthorneden Minerals, were prepared in the same way. Some of these slabs had crystal faces parallel to the c-axis and were used without additional polishing in the exeriments. For slabs that did not have crystal faces, one side parallel to the c-axis was polished to a 1-lm finish.</p><p>Experiments were performed in a piston-cylinder apparatus at 1.0 GPa and temperatures between 1,050 and 1,400 °C. Experiments at temperatures up to 1,200 °C used Au 75 Pd 25 capsules whereas those at higher temperatures used Pt capsules. Capsules were loaded with distilled water, approximately either 2 or 5.5 wt%, the starting glass (about 20 mg) and a millimetre-sized slab of zircon oriented with the crystal (or polished) face perpendicular to the capsule walls. Capsules were welded closed in a water bath to avoid volatile loss and placed in an oven at 110 °C for at least 2 h. Capsules were placed into 1.91 cm NaCl-Pyrex glass-crushable alumina assemblies <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Hudon et al. 1994</ref>) and run for 1 to 43 h. Experimental capsules AA1-AA28 were surrounded only by alumina powder. Water analyses of quenched melts in these capsules demonstrated severe water loss in many cases. Therefore, sample capsules AA29 and higher were surrounded by a thin layer, $10 mg, of pyrophyllite powder in the assembly to reduce water loss <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Freda et al. 2001)</ref>. Experiments were heated and pressured simultaneously to an overpressure of 0.2 GPa and then pressure was reduced to 1.0 GPa and held within 0.1 GPa of this value during the experiment. The observed temperatures were controlled within 2 °C of the set point except at the beginning of the experiment when the set point was exceeded by a maximum of 10 °C. Type C thermocouples were used and temperature gradients along the capsules were less than 15 °C <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Hudon et al. 1994)</ref>. Almost all experiments were quenched isobarically to below-solidus temperatures to reduce formation of quench bubbles and crystals; however, even non-isobarically quenched samples did not contain quench bubbles or crystals.</p><p>Quenched capsules were mounted longitudinally in epoxy, then prepared for analysis by ion and electron microprobes. Hydrogen concentrations in the run product glasses were analysed by secondary ion mass spectrometry to determine the water content of the melts. Samples were analysed with a Cameca IMS 4f ion microprobe at CNR-Centro di Studio per la Cristallochimica e la Cristallografia (Pavia) following the procedure described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Ottolini et al. (1995)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Freda et al. (2001)</ref>. Water contents were calculated from measured hydrogen concentrations as is the practice in SIMS work because this technique cannot distinguish between different H-speciations. Nevertheless, <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Schaller et al. (1992)</ref> found no evidence for the presence of significant quantities of HF in fluorinebearing hydrous haplogranitic glasses, which suggests that hydrogen is only associated with oxygen atoms in the melts and quenched glasses.</p><p>Reproducibility of SIMS analysis, measured on the standards, is typically £ ±5% relative (1 standard deviation) over a 1-day span. Overall accuracy in these total H 2 O analyses is $±10% relative, which represents the agreement among H 2 O values of our standards used for calibration (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Freda et al. 2001</ref> for details). <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Ottolini et al. (1995)</ref> showed that the use of energy filtering can significantly reduce matrix effects as well as the Hbackground, which represent the main limitations of applying SIMS to geological samples. Under controlled experimental conditions, very accurate results (better than ±10% rel.) are strictly dependent on the reliability of the H 2 O data of the standards used in the calibration procedure, which, in turn, implies previous precise and accurate work in the standardization of the standard materials themselves. Both SIMS and infrared spectroscopy (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Newman et al. 1986</ref>) require standards analysed by other techniques for the determination of water concentration in silicate glasses; however, when properly calibrated with the appropriate standards both techniques provide precise methods of water determination. M value calculated from <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Watson and Harrison (1983)</ref> d FM value calculated from <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Ryerson and Watson (1987)</ref> Zirconium contents of the glasses adjacent to the zircon as well as major elements, including F and Cl, were measured using a JEOL 8900 electron microprobe equipped with five spectrometers at an accelerating voltage of 15 kV and a current of 50 nA. Counting times on peaks were 50 s for zirconium and 20 s for all other elements. Counting times on backgrounds were one-half those used on peaks. The beam was in most cases focused to a 10-lm diameter, sometimes it was reduced to 5 lm to increase the number of points for short diffusion profiles. A PETH analysing crystal was used to detect zirconium. All data were reduced using the ZAF correction technique. The instrument was calibrated using zircon (Zr), pantelleritic obsidian (Si, Al, Fe, Na, K and Cl), spessartine (Mn), synthetic glass (F) and basaltic glass (Ti, Mg and Ca) standards. Accuracy was evaluated through analysis of a second pantelleritic obsidian with a Zr concentration of 1,885 ppm, previously measured by XRF. Electron microprobe analysis of this glass yielded a Zr concentration of 1,848±90 ppm. A minimum of three traverses normal to the zircon/glass interface were taken for each sample; spacing between analytical points was either 10 or 5 lm. Analyses closer than 30 lm to the zircon were not used because of secondary Zr fluorescence from the crystal <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Harrison and Watson 1983)</ref>. In some cases, expansion cracks formed during quenching intercepted the traverses making them unusable for diffusion measurements. For almost every sample, multiple traverses were averaged together to calculate Zr diffusion and zircon solubility, but in a few cases only one analytical traverse was successful. Nevertheless, because we performed more than one experiment at a given temperature, a minimum of two traverses at each temperature were used for the determination of Zr diffusion and zircon solubility.</p><p>Zirconium concentration profiles produced in experiments (e.g. Fig. <ref type="figure">1a</ref>) were used to determine Zr diffusion coefficients. Data were computed assuming a geometry in which the glass is considered a semi-infinite reservoir initially at a fixed concentration and the zircon-glass interface (located at distance x=0) as a fixed plane at constant composition. The zircon dissolution during the experiment involved a portion of the mineral short enough with respect to the length of the diffusion profile for this assumption to be valid. The Zr diffusion coefficient and its concentration in the melt at zircon saturation, C o , for this geometry can be calculated from the following solution to Fick's second law:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">C x;t À C o C bkg À C o ¼ erf x 2 ffiffiffiffiffi Dt p</formula><p>where C x,t is the concentration at distance x from the interface at time t (the experiment run duration), and C bkg is the Zr concentration in the melt at infinite distance away from the crystal <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Crank 1975)</ref>.</p><p>The solution to this equation adopted here is similar to that proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Harrison and Watson (1983)</ref>. The model requires that the data be linearized by inversion of the error function (Fig. <ref type="figure">1b</ref>):</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">x 2 ffiffiffiffiffi Dt p ¼ erf À1 C x;t À C o C bkg À C o</formula><p>where C o is a variable that must be estimated.  </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Zr diffusion in melt</head><p>The Zr diffusion measurements in LCO, LCl and MRF melts are listed in   At equivalent H 2 O concentrations only small differences in Zr diffusion, typically less than a factor of 2, exist between the hydrous metaluminous melt, LCO and either the fluorinated, MRF, or chlorinated, LCl, melts.</p><p>In the temperature range investigated Zr diffusion in each melt behaves in an Arrhenian manner and can be described by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">D ¼ D o exp ÀE a RT</formula><p>where D and D o are in m 2 s -1 , the activation energy is in kJ mol -1 , R is in J mol -1 K -1 , and T is in kelvin. Arrhenius equations were calculated using the technique of <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">York (1969)</ref>    <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">3</ref>).</p><p>Although the melt pools in these samples were too small for ion microprobe analysis, our study on water-loss from Au-Pd capsules at these conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Freda et al. 2001)</ref> constrains the H 2 O contents of the melts to be 4.5±0.5 wt%. At both temperatures the Zr concentrations in the zircon-saturated melt are within experimental uncertainty of the values measured using the dissolution technique.</p><p>Zircon solubility in melts with 4.5 wt% H 2 O is little affected by the presence or absence of 1.2 wt% F or 0.35 wt% Cl at the conditions studied (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>). Solubilities range from 767 ppm at 1,050 °C to 11,538 ppm at 1,400 °C. These solubilities have been used to calculate the partition coefficient of Zr between zircon and melt, and plotted against 1/T (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>). At H 2 O concentrations above 3 wt% the effect of adding additional water does not affect the Zr content of the melt by more than 10% relative (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>). Therefore, we have combined data from experiments with H 2 O contents greater than 3 wt% for the calculation of Zr partition coefficient between zircon and melt, D zircon=melt Zr</p><p>. The Zr partition coefficient in LCO can be described by: The solubility of zircon in melts containing $2 wt% H 2 O is lowered relative to melts with $4.5 wt% H 2 O (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>) and the partition coefficients correspondingly increased. The effect of increasing H 2 O concentrations from $0.5 to $4.5 wt% decreases the Zr partition coefficient between zircon and melt by approximately a factor of 5 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>). The MRF composition displays the smallest sensitivity of the partition coefficient to H 2 O content.</p><p>Inspection of the concentrations of other elements along Zr diffusion profiles demonstrated homogenous melt compositions. In no case was evidence found to support either counter diffusion or complexing of Zr with halogens.

The powder mixture was used to change the oxygen fugacity of the assembly from a value of approximately nickel-nickel oxide + 2 log units (Dalpeá nd <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Baker 2000)</ref> to a lower value, probably close to that of the wu¨stite-magnetite buffer <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Dalpe´and Baker 2000)</ref>. Evidence of this lower oxygen fugacity is the observation that these samples suffered measurable iron loss at 1,200 °C. After the experiment, samples AA39 and AA40 contained 0.20±0.02 and 0.60±0.04 wt% FeO*, respectively. The loss of iron in AA39 resulted in a slightly decreased concentration of Zr at zircon solubility and diffusivity (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>). The small amount of iron lost from AA40 had no discernible effect on either Zr concentration or diffusion (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>). One experiment at the high oxygen fugacity that suffered iron loss (AA29, FeO*=0.20±0.02) does not appear to have a lower zircon solubility than similar experiments with higher FeO* concentrations at the same oxygen fugacity. However, this experiment has a high standard deviation on the Zr concentration at zircon solubility (3,088±619 ppm), which almost encompasses the zircon solubility value for AA39 (2,325±354 ppm Zr). The iron-and zirconium-enriched modification of LCO, LCOZrFe, was synthesized because of the equivocal evidence for the effect of oxygen fugacity and iron concentration on zircon saturation. An additional crystallization experiment at 1,200 °C, 1.0 GPa using LCOZrFe, demonstrated that changing FeO* from 0.69 to 4.18 wt% causes the Zr concentration to increase by approximately 200 ppm when compared with the LCO composition (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">3</ref>). This increase is consistent with studies of zircon solubility in metaluminous haplogranitic systems at 1 atm, anhydrous conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Ellison and Hess 1986)</ref>.</p><p>The effects of oxygen fugacity on zircon solubility were further explored by two preliminary experiments using the LCOZrFe composition at 1 atm and the lowest temperature at which successful experiments could be performed on this anhydrous composition, 1,400 °C (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">3</ref>). (Experiments performed with LCOZr at this temperature produced heterogeneous glasses and were unsuitable, as were experiments with LCOZr and LCOZrFe at lower temperatures.) These experiments demonstrate that increasing oxygen fugacity 6 orders of magnitude from the wu¨stite-magnetite buffer to air decreases zircon solubility by 9% relative. These experiments demonstrate that oxygen fugacity can affect the solubility of zircon in silicic melts similar to LCO. However, to accurately quantify the effects of oxygen fugacity on zircon solubility requires a future set of solubility experiments at hydrous conditions in which both iron concentration and oxygen fugacity are well controlled.</p></div>

Our 1,200 °C measurements are approximately a factor of 10 higher than those of <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Harrison and Watson (1983)</ref>. The zirconium concentrations at zircon solubility are within error of those of <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Harrison and Watson (1983)</ref> at 1,400 °C, but at lower temperatures our values are consistently lower by approximately 30% relative at 1,200 °C (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>) and by a factor of 1.8 at 1,050 °C. These disagreements are not attributable to the difference in pressure between the experimental studies because pressure has been demonstrated to have an insignificant effect on zircon saturation <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Watson and Harrison 1983)</ref>. Nor can the differences be attributed to analytical problems because both <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Harrison and Watson (1983)</ref> and ourselves checked our analytical procedure by analysis of glasses with known zirconium concentrations.</p><p>The differences between our solubility results and those of <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Harrison and Watson (1983)</ref> are probably caused by different assemblies used in the piston-cylin-  der experiments. The assemblies of <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Harrison and Watson (1983)</ref> contained either internal pieces of unfired pyrophyllite (at 1,020 °C) or a pre-drilled graphite cylinder + pyrophyllite powder (at 1,200-1,400 °C, E.B. <ref type="bibr">Watson 1999, personal communication)</ref>. These assemblies differed substantially from those of this study and almost certainly resulted in a different oxygen fugacity than used in this study. The effect of oxygen fugacity on zircon solubility is hypothesized to be caused by its control of the Fe 3+ /Fe 2+ ratio in the melt. Ferric iron in silicate melts appears to behave as a network-former, whereas ferrous iron behaves as a network-modifier <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Hess 1995)</ref>. Thus as oxygen fugacity increases causing a concomitant increase in the Fe 3+ /Fe 2+ ratio, the proportion of network-formers in the melt should increase and the solubility of zircon decrease (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Ellison and Hess 1986)</ref>. Our results on zircon solubility in LCOZrFe at 1 atm suggest that the oxygen fugacities in the experiments of <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Harrison and Watson (1983)</ref> were below ours and resulted in higher zircon solubilities than those measured in this study. The similarity of our results and those of <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Harrison and Watson (1983)</ref> at 1,400 °C indicate that either the effect of oxygen fugacity on zircon solubility decreases with temperature or that our different assemblies had similar oxygen fugacities at this temperature.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Geological implications</head><p>Zircon solubility at magmatic temperatures</p><p>The zirconium concentrations at zircon saturation in natural metaluminous, felsic melts are low, as previously demonstrated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Harrison and Watson (1983)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Watson and Harrison (1983)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Keppler (1993)</ref>. Because of the small effects of halogen addition (at the concentrations investigated) on zirconium content at zircon saturation, the partitioning data for all melts with &gt;3 wt% H 2 O was combined and extrapolated down to magmatic temperatures. The extrapolation predicts a solubility of 60 ppm at 800 °C and 14 ppm at 700 °C. The 800 °C value is within error of the Zr concentration determined by <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Keppler (1993)</ref>, 67±22 ppm, in a H 2 O-($6 wt%) and zircon-saturated haplogranitic melt at 800 °C and 200 MPa. However, this value is approximately onethird that for LCO melt calculated using the solubility data in <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Watson and Harrison (1983)</ref>, 210 ppm (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7a</ref>).

Even more problematical is the observation that solubilities calculated at 800 and 700 °C in this study are below the Zr concentrations of granitic and rhyolitic rocks known to contain no inherited zircons, only trace amounts of zircon phenocrysts. Examples of this discrepancy are the zircon-saturated, high-silica rhyolites of the classic Bishop Tuff <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Hildreth 1981)</ref> whose low temperature member, $720 °C, has a Zr concentration of 85 ppm, and whose high temperature member, $790 °C, contains 145 ppm Zr (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref>).</p><p>We attribute differences between experiments and nature to the effects of iron concentration and oxygen fugacity.

The solubility of these iron-free melts falls significantly below the correlation line between zircon saturation values of Zr in the melt and M (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7a</ref>).

When zircon saturation results for LCO are extrapolated to 800 °C and plotted as a function of FM (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7b</ref>), the value predicted by the data of <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Harrison and Watson (1983)</ref> falls almost upon the correlation line. However, the lower solubility data of this study are approximately one-third of that predicted by direct measurements at 800 °C; it should be noted that this value is within the uncertainty of the correlation curve between Zr in the melt at zircon saturation and the FM value. Although the use of the FM parameter is superior to that of the M parameter to describe the compositional variations that control zircon saturation, it fails to adequately treat the effects of the Fe 3+ /Fe 2+ ratio on zircon solubility and considers all iron in the melt to behave as a network modifier. If we consider all iron in LCO to be Fe 3+ and treat it as a network former by adding it to aluminium in the denominator of the FM equation, then the position of LCO shifts to an FM value of 1.35 and the estimated solubility is consistent with direct saturation measurements at 800 °C (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7b</ref>). Unfortunately, we have not been able to measure the Fe 3+ /Fe 2+ ratio in our samples. Nevertheless, these results strongly suggest the need for a new parameter that describes the effects of major elements, H 2 O, Fe 2+ , Fe 3+ and halogens on zircon saturation, but this must await future study.</p><p>Our data predict low values of Zr concentration at zircon saturation for magmatic temperatures because of differences in oxygen fugacity between our experiments and nature.

The dashed line with the arrow in b shows the effect on the FM value of treating all Fe in LCO as a network former and adding it to the value for Al in the denominator of the FM equation b magmatic temperatures. The calculated Zr content in zircon-saturated melts at 800 °C with 4.5 wt% H 2 O in LCO melt is 45 ppm, in MRF melt is 76 ppm and in LCl melt is 65 ppm. The small increase in zircon solubility with $1 wt% fluorine addition to hydrous melts is consistent with the results of <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Keppler (1993)</ref>; however, in both studies the increase in Zr concentration is within experimental uncertainty. We conclude that addition of halogens at concentrations typical of many metaluminous silicic rocks does not significantly affect the saturation of zircon in melts similar to those studied because of the insensitivity of the Zr partition coefficient to the addition of either 0.35 wt% Cl or 1.2 wt% F in melts containing 4.5 wt% H 2 O. On the other hand, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Keppler (1993)</ref> has conclusively demonstrated that higher concentrations of fluorine, 2-6 wt%, which are rare in nature <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Carroll and Webster 1994)</ref>, can substantially enhance the solubility of zircon.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Effects of halogens on Zr diffusion</head><p>The effect of addition of 0.35 wt% Cl or 1.2 wt% F to Zr diffusion in metaluminous granitic melts is minor (Figs. 2, 3 and 4). At 1,200 °C the addition of Cl or F decreases Zr diffusion by a factor of 0.5 at most. The increase in activation energy for Zr diffusion with the addition of either F or Cl to melts with $4.5 wt% water is surprising because previous studies of hydrated, halogenated silicate melts demonstrated that F addition decreased activation energies for diffusion of major, non-alkali, elements <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Baker and Bossa`nyi 1994)</ref>. At the lower H 2 O concentrations studied, the activation energies for Zr diffusion in LCO and LCl are similar to those at $4.5 wt% H 2 O, although the pre-exponential factors are smaller. MRF with 2.3 wt% H 2 O displays both a lower activation energy and lower pre-exponential factor than when it contains 4.9 wt% H 2 O. All of these observations relating the Arrhenius parameters to halogen and H 2 O concentrations are presumably related to interactions between the halogens and the alkalies found in the zircono-silicate complexes in the melt <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Watson 1979;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Ellison and Hess 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Marr et al. 1998)</ref>, rather than direct complexing with Zr <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Farges 1996)</ref>. The exact details of these interactions remain to be studied.</p><p>Extrapolation of the Arrhenius lines in melts with 4.5 wt% H 2 O to a magmatic temperature of 800 °C produce Zr diffusivities of 4•10 -15 in LCO, 3•10 -16 in MRF, and 9•10 -17 m 2 s -1 in LCl. The factor of 44 difference in diffusion at this temperature results in a factor of $7 difference in the diffusion distance for a specific duration, using the estimation that x=(Dt) 1/2 , where x is the distance, D is the diffusion coefficient, and t is the time. Extrapolation of Arrhenius equations for melts with 2 wt% H 2 O is less precise than for those with 4.5 wt% H 2 O because of the smaller temperature range studied. For melts with H 2 O concentrations near 2 wt% the calculated diffusion coefficients at 800 °C are 6•10 -16 for LCO, 5•10 -16 for MRF, and 8•10 -18 m 2 s -1 for LCl. The difference of a factor of 100 between the diffusion of Zr in LCO and in LCl results in diffusion differences of approximately 10 for a given time duration.</p><p>The dissolution of 100 lm zircon crystals into zirconundersaturated melts at temperatures of 700 to 900 °C requires millions to billions of years if the granitic melt contains less than 0.5 wt% H 2 O <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Harrison and Watson 1983)</ref>. If the H 2 O concentration is increased to $4.5 wt% the dissolution time for zircon in LCO drops to $60 years at 900 °C and less than 2•10 4 years at 700 °C (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref>). Halogen addition affects the dissolution rate of zircon crystals because of the halogens' effects on both Zr diffusion and zircon solubility in the melt. At 900 °C the zircon dissolution time in MRF is 228 years and in LCl is 701 years. The maximum difference in dissolution times between hydrous melts with and without halogens is a factor of 100 between LCO, 2•10 4 years, and LCl, 2•10 6 years, at 700 °C (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref>). These calculations suggest that at temperatures of 800 °C and higher, the dissolution of zircons in any of the melts investigated will be geologically instantaneous. On the contrary, at the lowest temperature, during crustal melting, the presence of halogens can significantly affect the dissolution of zircon and diffusion of Zr in the melt.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>The results of this study, combined with previous ones, on zircon solubility and Zr diffusion demonstrate that the significant variables affecting stability in granitic magmas are temperature, water content, total iron, ferric/ferrous and alkali/alumina ratios <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Watson 1979;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Harrison and Watson 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Watson and Harrison 1983</ref>;  <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Marr et al. 1998)</ref>. Halogens dissolved in the melt at concentrations typically found in natural granitic or rhyolitic rocks, near to or less than 1 wt%, exert a small effect on the solubility of zircon and the diffusion of Zr in the melt. At the experimental conditions the effects of halogen addition are difficult to measure, but when the Arrhenius lines for melts with $ 4.5 wt% H 2 O are extrapolated to magmatic temperatures, Zr diffusion in the chlorinated melt is reduced compared with the halogen free and zfluorine-bearing melts. At 700 °C, Zr diffusion in the Cl-bearing melt is 1/100th of that in the halogen-free melt. Nevertheless, the effect of halogens on zircon solubility and diffusion of Zr in granitic melts is minor, and probably geologically unimportant at temperatures greater than 800 °C. Thus, the presence of small amounts of halogens in felsic rocks probably cannot explain the possible correlation between Zr and halogens sometimes observed.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig</head><label></label><figDesc>Fig. 1 a, b Zirconium diffusion profile (AA50) and error function inversion of the profile.
