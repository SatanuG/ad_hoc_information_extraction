<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>Sulfur is present in small but significant quantities in magmas of a wide variety of compositions (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Carroll and Rutherford 1988)</ref>. During magma ascent and crystallization, sulfur can be ''partitioned'' in several ways: sulfur-bearing minerals such as pyrrhotite and anhydrite may crystallize; an immiscible sulfur melt may form; sulfur may be incorporated as a trace element in many minerals <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Ricke 1960)</ref>; and it may enter the volatile phase, which can be either trapped in fluid inclusions or ultimately released to the environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Kress 1997)</ref>.</p><p>The diffusion of sulfur in magmas is important in controlling formation of bubbles and sulfur-bearing phases. However, the different dissolved species have different rates of diffusion and knowing the speciation therefore becomes critical. Additionally, the different species have different solubilities in the magmas, which determine the onset and growth of different magmatic sulfur minerals and bubbles; the different species also have different partitioning between melt and crystalline/vapor phases, and they have different roles in the overall melt structure and * E-mail: winther@cat.rpi.edu thus influence the physical properties of the melt in different ways.</p><p>Sulfur exists in six different oxidation states; however, only four of them, namely Ϫ2, Ϫ1, 0, and ϩ6, are commonly found in natural environments on earth and only two (Ϫ2 and ϩ6) are common in silicate melts <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Baker and Rutherford 1996)</ref>. Many sulfur-bearing species have been reported from natural systems including: SO , S 6ϩ , 2Ϫ 4 S 2Ϫ , COS, CS 2 , SO 2 , SO 3 , S , S , H 2 S, S, H 2 SO 4 (e.g.,</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Ϫ Ϫ 2 3</formula><p>Baker and Rutherford 1996; <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Cotton et al. 1976;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Fincham and Richardson 1954;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Gerlach and</ref><ref type="bibr">Nordlie 1975a and</ref><ref type="bibr">1975c)</ref>. The S 2Ϫ anion can substitute for O 2Ϫ in the silicate network whereas S 6ϩ can form SO . Many studies 2Ϫ 4</p><p>have addressed the speciation and solubility of sulfur in magmatic systems (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bradbury 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Carroll and Rutherford 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Gerlach and</ref><ref type="bibr">Nordlie 1975a, 1975c;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Haughton et al. 1974;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Mathez 1976;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Mysen and Dick 1977;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Mysen and Popp 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Poulson and Ohmoto 1990)</ref>. Only a few studies have addressed the diffusion of the various species in magmatic systems. The paper by <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Baker and Rutherford (1996)</ref> is based on dissolution of anhydrite and pyrrhotite into a rhyolite melt. Their experimental setup makes coupled diffusion involving calcium and sulfur or iron and sulfur unavoidable. In addi- tion, the presence of a multivalent element like iron raises questions as to its potential influence on the oxidation state of sulfur. Previous work by <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Watson et al. (1993)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Watson (1994)</ref> was of limited scope and restricted to diffusion of the sulfide ion. The focus of this work is to study the diffusion of sulfur in a simple silicate melt. Albite was chosen as the melt composition because it contains few elements, none of which occur in different oxidation states in nature. The experiments were set up using a diffusion couple consisting of two glasses with identical compositions, except for a trace amount of sulfur in one of them. It became clear that all the sulfur-doped glass produced contained trace amounts of carbon impurities. There were several potential sources of carbon contamination: organic solvents used for grinding; fine dust from the air; and diffusion from the graphite furnace used in the experimental setup. Sulfur-free glasses were fired in air at high temperatures (up to ϳ1000 ЊC), and in general did not contain carbon; however, the sulfur-bearing glass could not be fired as this would cause a sulfur loss. As carbon is present in most natural systems the carbon contamination makes the experiments more relevant to geological problems, and we decided to characterize the system rather than attempting to eliminate the carbon contamination. In this way the two main objectives of this paper became:</p><p>(1) characterize the S compounds present in albite with S-C-O-H, and (2) investigate sulfur diffusion in this system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Starting materials</head><p>Synthetic albite was made from high purity SiO 2 , Al 2 O 3 , and Na 2 CO 3 (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). In some cases, 1000-4000 ppm Si was replaced by equal stoichiometric amounts of Zr and Ge (introduced as ZrO 2 and GeO 2 ), whereas 1000-2000 ppm Al was replaced by equal stoichiometic amounts of Ga (added as Ga 2 O 3 ). The Zr, Ge, and Ga diffusion profiles were used to mark the original interface in the diffusion couples. The starting material was melted two times in a platinum crucible in air at ϳ1300 ЊC for 15 min. The CO 2 was lost from the carbonate during this process. Before, between, and after melting the material, it was carefully homogenized by grinding in an agate mortar with high-purity ethanol.</p><p>Synthetic albite glass with dissolved sulfur was made by first producing an albite glass as described above, except for a minor sodium deficit. Then Na 2 SO 4 was added to achieve the correct sodium level. This sample was melted two times at 1400 ЊC, 1 GPa for 1 h and homogenized before and between the melting by grinding in an agate mortar with high-purity ethanol. To ensure retention of sulfur in the sulfur-bearing samples, they were not fired at high temperature in air after the grinding in alcohol. This may have caused the presence of traces of residual carbon in the sample. In addition, lint from the air seems to have caused some minor carbon contamination. In some samples some of the Na 2 O was replaced by NaNO 3 , introducing a total of 1000-2000 ppm NO 2 to the sample. The nitrate helped oxidize the carbon to form CO 2 rather than graphite.</p><p>The diffusion couple was made by filling the lower part of the capsule with albite powder and placing a piece of polished, sulfur-doped glass above it. Ground, sulfurdoped glass was packed around the glass piece. If both sides of the diffusion couple contained sulfur, the material with the lower sulfur concentration was packed as a powder in the lower part of the capsule. Some experiments were done using other materials such as albite with graphite or barite to investigate the formation of radicals rather than obtaining only diffusion data. All starting materials were dried for at least 12 h at 105-110 ЊC prior to the experiment. In a few cases, sulfur-free starting materials were dried at 700 ЊC.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental technique</head><p>High-pressure experiments were performed in a 0.75Љ (19 mm) piston-cylinder apparatus. In diffusion experiments, the sample capsules were made from hard alumina lined on the outside with an oxidized iron sleeve (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). This sleeve helped maintain the structural integrity of the sample after the experiment, and the Fe 2 O 3 was intended to keep the environment oxidized. It was, however, not always the case that the iron oxide was preserved throughout the experiment. The capsules were placed inside crushable alumina parts fitting into a graphite furnace. In synthesis runs the powder was placed inside the crushable alumina, either with or without a hard alumina container. Outside the graphite furnace was a Pyrex glass sleeve, a salt cylinder, and a sheet of lead foil. The temperature was controlled using a W-Re thermocouple.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analytical methods</head><p>The samples were analyzed using an electron microprobe (JEOL 733 Superprobe). An expanded electron beam (20 or 30 m in diameter) was used with 15 kV acceleration voltage and a cup current of 12-75 nA. Currents up to 125 nA were used for measuring the sulfur peak position. For peak position measurements, an exact focusing of the beam on the surface is essential because  of its effect on the sample-detector geometry. If the sample is out of focus an apparent shift in the peak position by as much as 0.052 Њ 2 angle can occur (0.1 mm on the PET crystal spectrometer on the JEOL microprobe used). Potentially, pits burned in the surface of the sample could cause a change in the position of surface and thereby in the apparent peak position, and beam damage to the sample could cause changes in the sulfur speciation. However, repeated wavelength scans at the same position showed that the peak did not change position when the sample was damaged. What did change was the count rate of sulfur, which goes up with increased damage whereas the background count rate remains the same thereby giv-ing results that are too high. This change in apparent sulfur concentration was found to be larger than what could be expected as a result of decreasing sodium content in the glass alone. A Perkin-Elmer FTIR was used to obtain spectra of doubly polished glass disks. Micro Raman spectra were obtained using a T64000 Raman Spectrum system from JOBIN YVON-SPEX with a 514 nm laser. A few spectra were obtained using a Nicolet Raman 950 system with a 1064 nm laser. UV and visible-light spectra were obtained on a Hitachi U-2000 spectrophotometer running against air and scanning the wavelength range 150-1100 nm. An ESR (Electron Spin Resonance) spectrum was obtained from a Varian E9 ESR system using a time constant of 0.3 s, a modulation amplitude of 0.5 G, a microwave power of 0.02 W, and a scan time of 8 min.</p><p>The diffusion coefficients were determined by minimizing the difference between the observed data and an ideal diffusion profile calculated with the diffusion coefficient, the interface position, the high concentration, and the low concentration as variables to be optimized.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS: SULFUR COMPOUNDS</head><p>The conditions and results of selected runs are shown in Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>. Glasses of albite and sulfate-bearing albite are clear or slightly cloudy. If a graphite seed is planted in a sulfate-bearing glass and maintained at 1400 ЊC and 1 GPa for 1 h, a violet halo 40-90 m in diameter develops around the seed, reflecting the diffusion of carbon and/or oxygen and reaction with the sulfate. The size of the halo suggests that it is controlled by a species diffusing more or less with the same speed as sulfur, which could be oxygen. Over time, a carbon-bearing glass, especially after re-homogenization, will develop a strong characteristic violet color throughout. If a diffusion couple is prepared with violet, sulfur-bearing glass placed against clear sulfur-free glass, the violet color will not fade to clarity until the very end of the diffusion profile (Ͻ100 ppm S), and the sulfur-bearing part remains violet even after runs of 50 h. As shown below, this color is attributed to the presence of S and S radical anions.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">Ϫ Ϫ 2 3</formula><p>Most of the glass samples used fall in one of the following categories: albite; albite with sulfate; albite with sul- Note: 0408-10 were done in one experiment. 0415-18 were done in one experiment. 0422-25 were done in one experiment with the capsule slightly below the furnace center.

The nitrate was introduced into some samples in an attempt to maintain oxidized conditions. The samples were investigated using many techniques as described below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy</head><p>All FTIR spectra collected show an OH absorption peak around 3510 cm Ϫ1 . The sulfur-bearing glasses show in addition a CO 2 peak at 2350 cm Ϫ1 . The 3510 cm Ϫ1 OH stretching absorption band was used to estimate the water content using the calibration of <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Silver and Stolper (1989)</ref>. Sulfur-free glass (sample 1018) has 0.05 wt% water, whereas the sulfur-bearing glasses (samples 0107, 0219, and 0307) have 0.09-0.11 wt% water. The sulfur-bearing glasses are expected to have higher water contents because they were not fired in air at high temperature (which causes sulfur loss). Using the absorptivity coefficient of <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Fine and Stolper (1985)</ref>, the concentrations of CO 2 were calculated: The sulfur-free glass (1018) has 0 ppm; the non-violet sulfur-bearing glass (0107) has 78 ppm; and the violet sulfur-bearing glass has 100 ppm. These CO 2 levels are considered typical for the sulfurbearing glasses with carbon impurities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Thermal stability</head><p>Violet glass samples were heated in air. At approximately 900 ЊC the violet color started to diminish within an hour; this was accompanied by the formation of bubbles. The violet color was stable in air at 700 ЊC for at least 11 days. At elevated pressure, the violet color was stable to temperatures above 1500 ЊC. These experiments show that the violet color is associated with a volatile component that is stable at high temperatures.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Microprobe analyses: Sulfur peak positions</head><p>The location of the sulfur peak position changes by approximately 0.052 Њ 2 (0.10 mm on the PET crystal on the JEOL microprobe spectrometer used) when the immediate environment of the sulfur atom changes <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Carroll and Rutherford 1988)</ref>. This change corresponds to a change from sulfide (S 2Ϫ ) to sulfate (S 6ϩ ). The shape and location of the sulfur peak was measured over the range 171.80 to 172.18 mm for samples and standards of sulfides and sulfates. The ratio of sulfide to sulfate in the sample was estimated by minimizing the difference between the peak observed for the sample and a peak calculated as a linear combination of the peaks for barite and sphalerite standards. This ratio was converted to a percentage of sulfide. The percentage of sulfide is based on the assumption that all sulfur is present as sulfide or as sulfate; if other species like S and S are present,</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">Ϫ Ϫ 2 3</formula><p>this percentage becomes percent sulfide equivalents.</p><p>The results in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref> provide some representative examples of sulfur peak positions and calculated sulfide percentages in various glasses and standards. The results show that the peak position does not differ significantly between violet (e.g., sample 0313) and colorless (e.g., sample 0628) sulfate-bearing glasses. If the violet color is caused by S and S (as suggested by the spectro-</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">Ϫ Ϫ 2 3</formula><p>scopic analyses discussed below) this probably means that the concentration of S and S radical anions is rel-</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">Ϫ Ϫ 2 3</formula><p>atively low and that sulfate is the dominant sulfur species.</p><p>It is likely that the lack of change in sulfur peak position reflects a similarity in peak positions of S , S , and sul-</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">Ϫ Ϫ 2 3</formula><p>fate. Exactly what peak position these species have is difficult to evaluate because there are no pure standards. However, given that elemental sulfur has a peak position corresponding to 85% sulfide it is likely that S and S</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">Ϫ Ϫ 2 3</formula><p>have peak positions that also fall close to the sulfide peak. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref> also shows that sulfur diffused into graphite (sample 0313) has a peak position corresponding to a high sulfide content, indicating formation of carbon sulfides (most likely CS 2 ). Violet sulfur ϩ carbon-bearing glass 90 m from a graphite source (Experiment 0313, 4-7% sulfide) or a few tens of mircometers away from sheets of metallic Ti and Zr (Experiment 0613, 8-13% sulfide) show that even this close to reducing materials the sulfur is maintained as sulfate rather than sulfide. The implication is that the sulfate is very stable under the experimental conditions, even at very low values of . f o2</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Visible and ultraviolet light absorption spectroscopy</head><p>Samples of albite glass, albite glass containing carbon, albite glass with sulfate (few violet spots), and albite glass with both carbon and sulfur (with the characteristic violet color) were investigated by both visible and UV spectroscopy. The albite glass shows a large absorbance in the UV range. The spectrum of the violet glasses exhibits two strong absorption peaks not found in any of the other samples, one at 570 nm and one at 400 nm. Combined with the Raman spectroscopy data discussed below, these absorption bands are attributed to S and Ϫ 3 S , respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Clark et al. 1983)</ref>.

Additional evidence for the resonance-enhanced Raman effect with 514.5 nm excitation comes from experiments using an excitation wavelength of 1064 nm. When a 1064 nm excitation source is used, none of the bands assigned to S and</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">Ϫ 2</formula><p>S were observed in the Raman spectra. Several other</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">Ϫ 3</formula><p>Raman shifts are only observed in spectra from the violet glasses (514.5 nm excitation).

The scattering from both of these fundamentals yields a depolarization ratio of 0.5.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Electron spin resonance (ESR)</head><p>Electron spin resonance, ESR (or electron paramagnetic resonance, EPR) is a well-established technique for studying free radicals with a single unpaired electron. Exposing the sample to a strong magnetic field makes it possible to increase the energy separation between the two spin states of the unpaired electron. The sample absorbs electromagnetic energy at the frequency corresponding to the energy splitting between the two spin states. Sample 0426 (powdered violet glass) generated a good ESR spectrum showing that the sample actually does contain unpaired electrons. The spectrum shows evidence for the presence of two overlapping spectra implying two distinct radicals. The data are consistent with S-ions in a rhombic environment with a g tensor g 1 ϭ 2.037, g 2 ϭ 2.020, and g 3 ϭ 1.992. There is, in addition, an overlapping weaker spectrum. The stronger spectrum compares well with the data of <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Lunsford and Johnson (1973)</ref> reported for S . However, to prove this result pos-Ϫ 3 itively it would be necessary to prepare 34 S-doped samples, which was not done.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS: SULFUR DIFFUSION</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Activation energy of diffusion</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> shows an example of a sulfur diffusion profile and Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> summarizes the results. Experiments at 1400 ЊC and 1 GPa were performed with different run times and with different sulfur concentrations in each end of the diffusion couples: approximately 0-400, 400-1200, and 0-1200 ppm. The results show that the diffusion coefficients do not change significantly with either time or concentration within the ranges investigated. They also show that the results are reproducible. Experiments were performed at 1300, 1400, and 1500 ЊC (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref> and Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>). The results can be fitted to an Arrhenius-type relation given by the equation D ϭ D 0 exp(-Q/RT), from which the activation energy, Q (ϭ 458.1 Ϯ 50.8 kJ/mol), and pre-exponential factor, D 0 (ϭ 14.7 Ϯ 39.1 m 2 /s), have  <ref type="bibr">Baker and Rutherord (1996)</ref>. The remaining data are from <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Watson et al. (1993)</ref>.</p><p>been calculated, with r 2 ϭ 0.988. The calculations are based on average values from Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>. At 1642 ЊC this activation energy and pre-exponential factor give a diffusion coefficient close to the value calculated from the data of <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Baker and Rutherford (1996)</ref> for sulfur diffusion in a dry rhyolitic melt at 13-200 kPa and buffered at MNO (short for MnO-Mn 3 O 4 ). However, their equation was not calibrated above 1100 ЊC, so the significance of the similarity is uncertain. At lower temperatures their D values become larger than the values found here. This difference is due probably to the different melt composition and to the possible difference in sulfur species involved in the diffusion. Interestingly, the new sulfur diffusitivities for albite resemble earlier values for dry obsidian obtained under reducing conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Watson 1994</ref>) and for dry rhyolite obtained under very oxidizing (in air) conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Baker and Rutherford 1996)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Species diffusing</head><p>Five different species could be participating in the diffusion observed in the experiments: S , S , S 2Ϫ , SO , calculated from the sulfate/sulfide ratio based on the Xray peak shift and the total sulfur concentration. As explained previously, part of this ''sulfide'' may actually be S and S if their X-ray peak falls close to the sulfide</p><formula xml:id="formula_39">Ϫ Ϫ 2 3</formula><p>peak position. The amount of sulfate is total sulfur minus the ''sulfide'' (not shown on Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>). It is remarkable that in sample 1030 (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>), the S Ϫ 2 ϩ S and ''sulfide'' goes up in the diffusion zone and</p><formula xml:id="formula_40">Ϫ 3</formula><p>does not drop until the very end of the diffusion profile.

In</p><formula xml:id="formula_44">Ϫ Ϫ 2Ϫ 2 3 4</formula><p>albite, where sulfate is the dominating species, the overall diffusion is very slow-slower, in fact, than any of the other melts shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Effective diffusion radius</head><p>There could be two different reasons why the albite shows lower D values than any of the other melts: (1) the diffusion is controlled by different sulfur species and/or FIGURE 5. Effective diffusion radius shown as a function of temperature. This radius is not the actual physical radius of the diffusing species. The effective diffusion radius is used as a tool for comparing differences in diffusivity after having eliminated the effect of differences in melt viscosity. The melt viscosities used in the calculations were based on <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bottinga and Weill (1972)</ref> assuming that there is no change with pressure and that all melts are dry. All experiments, except for the rhyolite, were done at 1 GPa, whereas the rhyolite was investigated at lower pressure. If the pressure effect is taken into account, the 1 GPa values will move to larger radii, more than the rhyolite values will, making the difference between the rhyolite and the rest larger (based on results from <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Scarfe et al. 1979</ref>). If the small amounts of water in the albite melt is taken into account, the albite line will move to larger radii values corresponding to a slower viscosity adjusted diffusion, separating it from the rest of the melts. All viscosity calculations were based on coefficients for the 0.75-0.81 mole fraction SiO 2 range.</p><p>(2) the albite melt is significantly more polymerized, and has a much higher viscosity, than the other melts. Although the Stokes-Einstein equation does not provide a reliable tool for calculating diffusion coefficients in melts of this type (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Liang et al. 1996)</ref>, it is reasonable to assume that there still will be an inverse proportionality between diffusion coefficients and melt viscosity. The Stokes-Einstein equation has been rearranged to provide an ''effective diffusion radius,'' r ϭ kT/6D, where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature in K, is the viscosity, and D the diffusion coefficient. The radius calculated here does not correspond to the radius of the actual species diffusing and is exclusively used as a tool for comparing differences in diffusivities over and above the effect of viscosity: The larger the effective diffusion radius the slower the effective diffusivity. Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref> shows a plot where the effective diffusion radius is plotted as a function of temperature for some of the melts shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>. If the relationship between viscosity and temperature is the same as the relationship between the diffusion coefficient and viscosity, all lines should be horizontal in this diagram. The lines for sulfur in dry rhyolite and obsidian are, within error, horizontal. The slope of the line for S /S -bearing albite may result from the un- S over temperature, suggesting that at higher tempera-</p><formula xml:id="formula_47">Ϫ 3</formula><p>tures there is more of the smaller (and faster diffusing) S . Given the uncertainty on the determinations of dif-</p><formula xml:id="formula_48">Ϫ 2</formula><p>fusion coefficients and melt viscosities the ''viscosity-corrected diffusivity'' of sulfur in albite melt is only slightly slower than it is in obsidian and dry dacite. The dry rhyolite <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Baker and Rutherford 1996)</ref>, despite a composition almost identical to the obsidian, has a somewhat higher diffusivity. This difference could be caused by differences in sulfur speciation and experimental techniques. If the S and S are the rate-controlling species for diffusion</p><formula xml:id="formula_49">Ϫ Ϫ 2 3</formula><p>in the albite melt, and if sulfide is primarily controlling the diffusion in the obsidian and the dacite, then it appears that the sulfide has a similar or slightly higher rate of diffusion. This conclusion does not, however, take into account how large a fraction of the sulfur is present as very slow-diffusing sulfate.</p><p>Based on the results presented in Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>, the effective diffusion radius is 8.4 ϫ 10 Ϫ13 m for sulfide-controlled diffusion, 1.5 ϫ 10 Ϫ12 m for S /S -dominated diffusion,</p><formula xml:id="formula_50">Ϫ Ϫ 2 3</formula><p>and much larger still for sulfate-controlled diffusion. This effective diffusion radius takes into account the effect of size as well as bonding to the melt structure. The effective diffusion radius of S /S is a factor 1.8 higher than for</p><formula xml:id="formula_51">Ϫ Ϫ 2 3</formula><p>sulfide. The real radius, not effective diffusion radius, of an S atom (likely to equal the smallest radius of an S-S Ϫ or S-S-S Ϫ molecule) is 1.6 times larger than the radius of an S 2Ϫ ion. Taking all uncertainties into account there is no real difference between the values of 1.6 and 1.8. This result indicates that size is a large part of the explanation for the difference in diffusivity. Raman spectroscopy has shown that the S /S molecules with a valence</p><formula xml:id="formula_52">Ϫ Ϫ 2 3</formula><p>of Ϫ1 do form bonds to the glass structure (and presumably as well to the melt structure); these bonds are, however, likely to be weaker than the bonds formed to the sulfide ion with a valence of Ϫ2. On the other hand, the S /S radical anions are longer than the round sulfide ion</p><formula xml:id="formula_53">Ϫ Ϫ 2 3</formula><p>and thus are hindered in their diffusion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSIONS</head><p>Sulfur can occur in magmas as sulfate, sulfide, S or</p><formula xml:id="formula_54">Ϫ 2</formula><p>S . The melt composition, in particular the presence or Ϫ 3 absence of chalcophile elements, and the determine f o2 which sulfur species will be present. It was found that in the presence of carbon under reducing conditions, the radical anions S or S form in low concentrations. The sulfate diffuses significantly more slowly than the other species (sulfide, S , or S ), which means that at high</p><formula xml:id="formula_55">Ϫ Ϫ 2 3</formula><p>and in the absence of chalcophile elements the diffu-f o2 sion of sulfur slows down significantly. To compare diffusivities in melts of different compositions an ''effective diffusion radius'' was calculated. Although the Stokes-Einstein equation is known to be invalid for this type of melt, it is assumed that the inverse relationship between melt viscosity and diffusivity nevertheless holds. In this way the calculated radius does not correspond to the actual radius of the species diffusing but it serves as a gauge of viscosity-independent diffusion. It is suggested that these ''effective diffusion radii'' can be used to estimate the diffusion coefficients in any melt as long as the melt viscosity can be estimated accurately at the temperature in concern.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>FIGURE 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>FIGURE 1.
