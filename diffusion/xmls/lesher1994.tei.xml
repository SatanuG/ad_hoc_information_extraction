<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Diffusion coefficients that govern chemical and isotopic exchange of Sr and Nd were determined from compositional profiles developed between juxtaposed anhydrous basaltic and rhyolitic liquids. Analysis of simple diffusion couples involving isotopically enriched and normal tholeiitic basalt and metaluminous rhyolite recover Sr and Nd self-diffusion coefficients (D*) in the end-member compositions of contrasting polymerization. Self-diffusion of Sr is 7 times faster in basaltic melt than rhyolitic melt at 1255øC and 1 GPa, while self-diffusion of Nd is more than 1 order of magnitude greater in basalt than rhyolite. Also, at these conditions, D•r is a factor of 3 greater than D•q d in basalt and an order of magnitude greater than D•q d in rhyolite. Variations in D•r and D•q d with bulk composition and temperature between 1255ø-1465øC are described by In D•r = -16.25 -(16348/T) + 8.02(0.73 -Xsio2) and In D•q d = -13.73 -(23875/T) + 14.43(0.73 -Xsi%), where the units of D* are square meters per second, T is temperature in kelvins, and X si % is weight fraction silica. The results of a Boltzmann-Matano analysis of 87Sr/ESr and 144Nd/ENd profiles of complex diffusion couples composed of isotopically normal basalt and enriched rhyolite yield diffusion coefficients for intermediate bulk compositions in agreement with interpolated values given by the relationships above. An important feature of the interdiffusion of basaltic and rhyolitic liquids is the equilibration of isotopic composition in advance of chemical homogenization. This behavior is best displayed by Sr in the present experiments and predicted for Nd. In addition, Sr, Nd, and A1 show initial periods of uphill diffusion, while other melt components diffuse down their respective concentration gradients leading to chemical homogenization. Despite uphill diffusive effects, the rate of chemical homogenization is slow and approximated by the effective BM binary diffusion coefficient for silica, that is, In Dsi•2 = -6.70 -(31195/T) + 12.28(0.52 -Xsi%). Chemical fluxes of Sr and Nd are calculated using Darken's (1948) equation, that is, D? = D•[1 + (d In 'Yi/d In xi)], relating the chemical diffusion coefficient for species i(D?) defined by Fick's law to the self-diffusion coefficient (D?) for the species and the variation in the species' activity coefficient, ¾i, with concentration x i along the diffusional pathway. Parameters of the Darken equation are provided in this study and from the literature. Simulations of interdiffusion of basalt and rhyolite quantitatively reproduce salient features of the present experiments including (1) the initial stage of Sr and Nd uphill diffusion into silica-poor regions of couples followed by back diffusion into silica-rich regions, (2) strong asymmetry in the evolving Sr and Nd isotopic profiles, and (3) equilibration of isotopic composition in advance of bulk chemical composition. These results are considered in a magmatic context, where intimate blending of magmas during mixing is frustrated by large rheological contrasts and/or insufficient exposure time. Time-dependent diffusional exchange between mingling magmas leads to covariations in chemical and isotopic compositions that differ markedly from the expectations of bulk mixing. Examples presented offer alternative interpretations for the compositional relationships found among magmatic rocks of hybrid origin.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head> <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Wiebe, 1973</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Wiebe, , 1980]]</ref><p>. In these studies it was found that the alkalies, in particular, were locally redistributed, while in other respects the magmas remained largely unmodified. More recent field and geochemical studies show that in addition to the alkalies other mobile silicate species are redistributed during interaction at magmatic conditions and that isotopic compositions can be modified selectively [Bacon and Metz, 1984; <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Grove et al., 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Allen, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr">Blichert-Tort et al., 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Stewart and DePaolo, 1992]</ref>. At one extreme, magma mixing and/or contamination can be regarded as a completely efficient process resulting in the formation of new compositions intermediate between the end-member components. The compositional spectrum generated by sequentially mixing different proportions of the end-members results in end products with compositions conforming to the expectations of well-established bulk mixing relations <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[Langmuir et al., 1978]</ref>. Models of bulk mixing fulfill the essential requirement of material balance and provide a useful reference against which to contrast geochemical data of comagmatic rocks. The challenge facing petrologists is to establish case by case whether deviations from the predictions of bulk mixing are due to (1) spatial or temporal changes in the composition of one or more of the end-member mixing components, (2) partial and variable reaction among commingled magmas (as well as with host rocks), or (3) the operation of additional processes.</p><p>Mixing of miscible fluids involves the mechanical stretching and folding of the admixture <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[Ottino, 1989]</ref>. Mechanical deformation of the admixture does not alter composition but can lead to an increase in interfacial area between mingled phases and a reduction in the length scale of compositional heterogeneities that distinguish them. Changes in composition of a given domain are achieved by diffusional exchange with the immediate surroundings. Because molecular diffusion coefficients for silicate melt are small (10-1ø-10 -14 m 2 s -1) <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[Hofmann, 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Watson and Baker, 1991]</ref>, chemical modification by diffusion is possible only on a local scale (i.e., meters or less) before most magma bodies solidify (10 3 to 105 years) <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[Oldenburg et al., 1989</ref>]. Likewise, differences in rheology and density of mingled magmas give rise to mechanical forces that promote segregation and isolation of partially reacted magmas <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[Huppert and Sparks, 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">McBirney et al., 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Oldenburg et al., 1989</ref>]. Obstacles to intimate mixing imposed by transport kinetics and rheology suggest that chemical and isotopic heterogeneities are likely to persist on length scales of more than a meter in all but the most vigorously convecting, long-lived magmatic systems. How then do hybrid magmas produced during the transient stages of mixing relate to one another and to the end-member compositions from which they evolved? Moreover, can we use insights gained from examination of hybridized magmas to constrain the scales (time and length) of mixing processes and the compositions of end-members that do not survive unmodified? These questions serve as focus for the following study of the transport properties of two important magmatic tracers of differentiation, Sr and Nd.</p><p>Preliminary results of this work were reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Lesher [1990]</ref>. In this expanded study I first present a theoretical framework for quantitatively modeling diffusion of trace constituents in multicomponent systems, drawing on Darken's <ref type="bibr">[ 1948]</ref>  Holmann <ref type="bibr">[1980]</ref> suggested that, in practice, self-diffusion and tracer diffusion coefficients for silicate liquids give similar measures of the intrinsic mobility of a component, although values may differ depending on whether material transport occurs along interstitial pathways, among structural vacancies, or by interchange of nearest neighbors. In contrast, chemical diffusion occurs when either the concentration of the impurity becomes sufficiently elevated to induce activity gradients in other chemical species or preexisting compositional gradients cause nonideal behavior of the impurity. As such, tracer diffusion and chemical diffusion are mutually exclusive in the sense that the governing diffusion coefficients cannot be measured concurrently. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Darken [1948]</ref> proposed that for multicomponent diffusion the velocity of a given atom in the presence of other concentration gradients may be expressed as a product of the force acting on the species in the potential field and the velocity per unit force. The force acting on a single atom is the negative gradient of chemical potential divided by Avogadro's number, while the velocity of the species per unit force is referred to as the mobility. The amount (in grams) of species i passing through a unit area normal to the diffusion direction z per unit time is  <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">, 1974;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Sato, 1974;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Watson, 1982;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Watson and Jurewicz, 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Johnston and Wyllie, 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Koyaguchi, 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Zhang et al., 1989</ref>]. These field and experimental observations serve to illustrate the complexity of diffusion in magmatic systems that demand formulations of chemical diffusion coefficients such as equation (3a). Uphill diffusion is also possible due to cross coupling in certain formulations of the complete diffusion coefficient matrix, even though ideal mixing is assumed <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[Baker, 1992]</ref>. Nevertheless, chemical fluxes, whether uphill or downhill, progress so as to reduce gradients in activity of the diffusing species. This evolution leads to reductions in the absolute magnitude of Darken diffusion coefficients and, in turn, chemical fluxes. For mobile species (large D*) the reduction of activity gradients may occur quickly and well in advance of bulk chemical homogenization of the system. <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Watson [1982]</ref> proposed that the direction of a chemical flux along a polymerization gradient in silicate liquid can be anticipated by considering the flux required to bring the component closer to an equal activity distribution as expected if partitioning between immiscible melts. While comparisons with two-liquid partitioning are qualitative, the notion that the most mobile species of silicate liquid tend to approach isoactivity distributions rapidly during interdiffusion can be rationalized on thermodynamic grounds from <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Darken's [1948]</ref>  </p><formula xml:id="formula_0">1 d/x• Ji -- CiM i •,<label>(la)</label></formula></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Design Considerations</head><p>The experimental techniques used in this study of silicate liquid interdiffusion are similar to previous procedures whereby starting materials of contrasting composition are juxtaposed, raised to liquidus temperatures, held isothermally for a prescribed time, and quenched to glass <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[Lesher, 1990]</ref>. The compositional gradients developed within the interfacial region of the couple are characterized by microbeam techniques. Results from two sets of experiments are reported here. In the first set, simple diffusion couples are composed of liquids of identical chemical composition, while differing in Sr and Nd isotopic composition. In the second set, isotopically enriched rhyolite is juxtaposed to the isotopically normal basalt. Analyses of isotopic gradients persisting in these runs permit quantification of Sr and Nd selfdiffusion coefficients for end-member liquids and intermediate compositions. These latter experiments also allow for evaluations of the Darken diffusion model.</p></div>

This choice of starting materials is motivated by concurrent field and geochemical studies of the intrusive complex that focus on aspects of crustal contamination <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[Blichert-Toft et al., 1992]</ref>.

This valuable insight is only provided for the limited number of silicate systems possessing stable liquid immiscibility. Moreover, even in those cases, immiscible liquids cannot be used to infer the variation of activity coefficients for compositions between the end-member liquids. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Lesher [1986]</ref> showed that information over the entire compositional path can be recovered from Soret arrays. Drawing on Soret data for naturally occurring silicate liquids <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[Lesher, 1986]</ref>, the variations of activity coefficients for Sr and rare earth elements with bulk composition are expressed as third-order polynomials in In (XsM), where XsM is the fraction of network-modifying  Figure <ref type="figure">8</ref> shows these results in the same format as Figure <ref type="figure">7</ref>.</p></div>

Experimental conditions iden-</head><p>In this case the agreement between model and experimental concentration profiles is exceptional. The model predicts extensive uphill diffusion of Nd, producing enrichment in the silica-poor region of the couple. Near-uniform Sr activity across the couple is also predicted consistent with the experimental observation of near-uniform Sr isotopic composition. Likewise, the small activity gradient computed for Nd is consistent with the experimental observation that a modest Nd isotopic gradient persists in run 6.</p><p>Figures <ref type="figure">7</ref> and<ref type="figure">8</ref> show that the salient features of the experimental chemical and isotopic diffusion profiles for Sr and Nd are accounted for by the Darken diffusion model. These results suggest that chemical diffusion of other important trace components of magmas can be accounted for quantitatively using a similar approach, although extending this treatment must await the acquisition of pertinent kinetic and thermodynamic data. Likewise, the explicit dependence of D c on species activity suggests that interdiffusion profiles in turn can be used to quantify activity-composition relationships of solutions. Retrieving such information from interdiffusion studies of silicate liquids will be most readily accomplished for highly mobile species that rapidly minimize activity differences along a chemical interdiffusion gradient <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[Lesher, 1991]</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Richter [1993]</ref> recently interpreted the results of <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Lesher [ 1990]</ref> in this way. However, for more sluggish diffusing species it is unlikely that an isoactivity relationship will be achieved prior to bulk homogenization of the system. To extract meaningful thermodynamic information for these species requires that the intrinsic mobilities (i.e., self-diffusion coefficients) of the species be determined separately, as undertaken here for Sr and Nd. With these constraints, • remains as the only free parameter in (8). Solutions that give the best fit to experimental interdiffusion profiles yield the compositional dependence of % In this way, interdiffusion studies offer a supplemental approach to characterize the solution properties of silicate liquids. The parameterization for ?Sr and •Na presented in Table <ref type="table">4</ref> has not been revised by this approach to avoid diminishing the predictive feature of the diffusion model. Nevertheless, the present analysis serves to illustrate the utility of Darken's theory for modeling diffusion of trace constituents in magmas and hopefully will provide stimulus for further work in this area.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Implications for Magma Mixing</head><p>As outlined in the introduction, the motivation for the present study comes in large part from the recognition that many igneous rock suites owe their origin to magma mixing. In some situations, mixing is called upon to reduce the compositional range for magmas, while in other cases, magma mixing is responsible for an expanding compositional diversity. This dichotomy regarding the role of mixing in magmatic systems is also shared by fluid mixing problems encountered in geophysics and material science <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[Ottino, 1989]</ref>.</p><p>Recent studies of magmatic systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[Sparks and Marshall, 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bacon, 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Frost and Mahood, 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Green, 1988]</ref> emphasize the importance of changes in rheology that occur during the mingling magmas. Higher liquidus temperatures for mafic compared to felsic magmas and the dramatic increase in effective viscosity accompanying crystallization <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[Shaw, 1969;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Ryerson et al., 1988</ref>] contribute to the difficul-ties in thoroughly homogenizing magmas on reasonable magmatic time scales. <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Sparks and Marshall [ 1986]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Frost and Mahood [1987]</ref> concluded that the most favorable conditions for complete homogenization exist when the chemical contrast between mingling magmas is small (&lt;10 wt % SiO2) or when the volume of mafic magma exceeds that of felsic magma. Smaller proportions of basaltic magma injected or entrained into silicic systems quench to form mafic enclaves. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Oldenburg et al. [1989]</ref> examined the effects of chamber shape and size, magma viscosity, and bulk composition on the dynamics of mixing of melt-dominated systems. Their theoretical work indicates that large-volume, thermally well-connected mafic bodies homogenize on rapid time scales (10 3 to 10 4 years), while silicic systems remain heterogeneous for several million years.</p><p>These studies provide a sound physical basis for interpreting field occurrences of heterogeneously banded and enclave-beating magmatic rocks. We are less appreciative of the geochemical consequences of magma interactions when the time available is not sufficient for homogenization so whatever reaction does occur is rate limited by diffusional processes. The experimental results of the previous sections show some of the complications that result from interdiffusion among silicate liquids, particularly with regard to the contrasting rates of chemical and isotopic homogenization. It is instructive to consider the implications of these results for interpreting compositional data on magmatic rocks that may be, or are known to be, of hybrid origin.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Irreversible Mixing and Compositional Trajectories</head><p>In this example, mixing is assumed to involve two endmember magmas that are broadly basaltic (50 wt % SiO2) and rhyolitic (70 wt % SiO2) in composition. Reaction between these magmas is assumed to be rate limited by diffusion from spherical blobs of rhyolite entrained in basalt that remains well stirred. It is further assumed that the magmas remain crystal-free and are volatile-poor. Crystallization during mingling can provide a sink for compatible elements <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[Johnston and Wyllie, 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Blichert-Toft et al., 1992]</ref> and will increase the tortuosity of the liquid diffusional pathway, both factors reducing the efficiency of mixing. Conversely, the addition of volatile components, in particular H20, will enhance diffusion rates in silicate liquids <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[Jambon et al., 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Rapp and Watson, 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Koyaguchi, 1989]</ref>      that differences in the initial compositions of the endmembers can have a large influence on the compositional trajectories followed during hybridization. For example, if the concentrations of Sr and Nd were originally equivalent in both magmas, chemical diffusion would initially be uphill for both elements until isoactivity distributions were attained.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Felsic Blobs TIME</head><p>Conversely, if the concentration differences were larger than assumed in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">9</ref>, hybridization could proceed to homogenization without a period of uphill diffusion.</p><p>In scaling diffusional reactions to magmatic conditions by means of the diffusive impedance it becomes readily apparent that even if the basaltic reservoir remains well stirred, modification of the mafic and felsic reservoirs occurs slowly and on length scales of less than a few meters for reasonable magmatic time scales (104-105 years) (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">12</ref>). This leads to two important conclusions supported by numerous studies cited above. First, thorough blending of magmas requires that the size of compositionally distinct domains be reduced by vigorous convection to permit efficient diffusional reaction in the melt. Second, if this is not accomplished, any modification in composition will be highly selective and favor the most mobile components. Indeed the products of incomplete mixing will bear little resemblance to system, and felsic blobs occupying 25% of the system. Although it is assumed that the system achieves thermal equilibrium instantaneously and remains isothermal, it should also be noted that the volume proportion of basalt and rhyolite chosen in this example would reach homogene- Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">11</ref> shows the covariation of Sr and Nd isotopic compositions for the model systems. Complementary segments for both volume proportions again display characteristically sigmoidal forms resulting from the markedly higher self-diffusion coefficient for Sr compared to Nd. As seen in the previous covariation diagrams, irreversible mixing paths for complementary mafic and felsic hybrids converge to an identical composition on the bulk mixing hyperbola dictated by the initial volume proportions of the end-members. The contrast in the compositional evolution of hybrids and the expectations of bulk mixing is clearly shown by the Sr-Nd isotope systematics. It is worth emphasizing that the isotopic relations for irreversible mixing of magmas of broadly similar chemical composition will be analogous to those shown here involving compositional extremes. Mixing is time dependent. Large viscosity contrasts between magmas merely further impedes the process.</p><p>Similar isotopic relationships can be anticipated among any two tracers that possess measurably different selfdiffusion rates. Some appreciation for the magnitude of this  The foregoing discussion assumes that high field strength cations obey the simple diffusion coefficient-charge density correlation shown by <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Hofmann [1980]</ref> for monovalent, divalent, and trivalent cations. However, differences are found between measured two-liquid partition coefficients for high field strength elements (i.e., Zr and Ta) and expectations based on similar charge density considerations <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[Watson, 1976]</ref>. These differences are attributed to the formation of oxyanions involving the high field strength cations that are more or less independent of the silicate network <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[Hess, 1989]</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Lesher and Walker [1991]</ref>  Knowledge of the length scale of mingling at the primary site of contamination, and the identity of end-member diabase and crust-derived granophyre participating in the mixing process, were essential in establishing the fundamental role of selective contamination in the macrodike system. However, in many plutonic and volcanic settings such constraints are lacking, and the role of mixing must be inferred from the geochemical record alone. Considerations of the time dependence of mixing may help to resolve some discrepancies between the magmatic record and current geochemical modeling that assumes bulk mixing. For example, the evolution of basaltic magmas selectively contaminated with Sr from crustal melts will display shallow sloping arrays in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">11</ref>. Concluding that these magmas evolved by bulk mixing on the basis of isotopic relationships alone would require that the crustal source, at the very least, had a markedly higher Sr/Nd ratio than in actuality. Alternatively, the lack of coherence to a simple bulk mixing model could be interpreted as indicating the involvement of additional end-members, although again this would be incorrect.</p><p>These considerations are also important for interpreting the compositional significance of and establishing protoliths of magmatic inclusions and mafic enclaves common to silicic plutonic systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[Bacon and Metz, 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Cantagrel et al., 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Furman and Spera, 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Holden et al., 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Allen, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">van der Laan and Wyllie, 1993]</ref>. Although modification of inclusions and enclaves will be strongly controlled by their compositions and that of the host, as well as the thermal evolution of the system, the high intrinsic mobility of Sr compared to Nd means that 87Sr/86Sr ratios may be markedly affected, while •43Nd/•nnNd ratios remain unmodified. For this reason the Nd isotopic composition of hybrid rocks will be a more reliable constraint on source characteristics than will 87Sr/86Sr composition. Similarly, uniformity in Nd isotopic composition, rather than 87Sr/86Sr ratios, should be sought in establishing cogenetic links among mingled magmas or between enclaves and their hosts. Conversely, Sr isotope relations may offer constraints on the duration of entrainment and reaction.</p><p>In conclusion, issues concerning selective contamination of magmas raised in this study do not diminish the potential significance of bulk mixing in igneous petrogenesis. Rather this study highlights a number of the important geochemical consequences of magma mixing that should be considered when mixing is arrested before thorough blending. Mechanical and diffusional processes are intimately linked in open magmatic systems. The Darken diffusion model as applied in this study offers an approach to quantifying aspects of the diffusional component of mixing. This approach can be readily extended to include other constituents of magmas with laboratory measurements of self diffusion and activity coefficients. I emphasize that the geochemical record preserved in suites of commingled magmas can provide insights into the dynamics and time scales of mixing. We forfeit this information on the assumption, rather than demonstration, that hyhbrid magmas are related by bulk mixing.</p><p>In conclusion, issues concerning selective contamination of magmas raised in this study do not diminish the potential significance of bulk mixing in igneous petrogenesis. Rather, this study highlights some of the important geochemical consequences of magma mixing when the process is arrested before completion. Diffusion is one fundamental process of material exchange. Efficient blending of magmas implies not only vigorous mechanical stirring but sufficient time for chemical homogenization by diffusion. The role of mechanical and diffusional processes are intimately linked in open magmatic systems. The record preserved in suites of cornmingled magmas give us insight into irreversible paths leading to homogenization.

Open system behavior during transient episodes of mixing and reaction with host rocks involves a complex interplay between convective and diffusive modes of mass transfer. Selective contamination of magmas was first recognized by petrologists examining small-scale relationships among inclusions and their host rocks and among commingled magmas [e.g., Walker and Skelhorn, 1966; Al-Rawy and Carmichael, 1967; Sigurdsson, 1968; Maury and Bizouard, 1974; Sato, 1974;</figDesc></figure>

With this background the results of laboratory experiments of silicate liquid interdiffusion are evaluated and used to obtain estimates of Sr and Nd mobilities. By combining these results with activity coefficient data, Darken's theory is shown to account accurately for the behavior of Sr and Nd during diffusional reaction of basaltic and rhyolitic liquids. In the final section the Darken model is used to illustrate geochemical consequences of time-dependent mixing at magmatic conditions helpful in the interpretation of contaminated and commindiffusion are generally distinguished in studies of silicate liquids, that is, self-diffusion, tracer diffusion, and chemical diffusion [e.g., Holmann, 1980; Hess, 1989]. To characterize self-diffusion and tracer diffusion, it is common practice to introduce to a sample labeled atoms, either radioactive or stable isotope tracers. Self-diffusion refers to motion of the tracer relative to other isotopes of the same chemical species in the absence of a chemical concentration gradient. Homogenization of isotopic composition occurs by random interchange of isotopes and depends on the frequency with which atoms are activated for a jump. Tracer diffusion, sensu stricto, is defined by the directional flux of a chemical species introduced into a medium in low concentration and not otherwise present. The impurity is typically applied as a surface film, and diffusion of the species into the sample is monitored under controlled P and T.</figDesc></figure>

Although further study of self-diffusion in intermediate composition liquids is warranted, the present results show the similarity in the rates of isotopic exchange whether occurring under isochemical conditions (simple diffusion couples) or accompanying a chemical flux (complex diffusion couples).

Although ignoring crystallization and assuming that melts are anhydrous restrict the applicability of the present model, the following calculations do serve to illustrate important compositional features of time-dependent mixing. The simulation of time-dependent reaction of blobs of rhyolite entrained in basalt is accomplished by modifying the FTCS explicit differencing scheme above for radial diffusion [see Crank, 1975, p. 89]. Chemical diffusion coefficients for Sr and Nd are constrained by the Darken model using (6), (7a), and (7b) and expressions given in Table 4. A wellstirred basaltic reservoir is simulated in the model by averaging the composition of the mafic reservoir after each time step. Thus progressive changes in compositions of mafic and felsic reservoirs are governed by the appropriate diffusion coefficients for components of the blobs. The composition reported for the felsic blobs represents the integrated concentration over the zoned parcel of radius I.</figDesc></figure>

To the extent that two-liquid and Soret analogies provide guidance, caution is warranted in using Hofmann' s correlation to estimate high field strength cation self-diffusion and tracer diffusion coefficients. Nevertheless, it remains that an important test for selective contamination in nature will be a demonstration that the extent of isotopic modification is directly proportional to the magnitude of the tracer's selfstudy of selective contamination of the Miki Fjord and Vandfaldsdalen macrodikes of East Greenland, Blichert-Toft et al. [1992] showed covariations in Sr and Nd isotopic compositions of commingled crust-derived granophyre and diabase consistent with diffusional reaction at magmatic conditions, as portrayed in Figures 11 and 12. Allen [1991] also presents evidence for partial diffusional equilibration of Sr and Nd isotopic compositions, in this case between mafic enclaves and host granite of the Turtle Pluton of southeastern California. In both of these natural examples the ability to isolate the diffusional component of contamination was possible given the small-scale sampling strategies employed and the characterization of (at least) two distinct isotope systems. Stewart and DePaolo [1992] recently reported covariations in 87Sr/86Sr and •43Nd/•44Nd ratios of mafic cumulates from the uppermost cycle unit of the Muskox intrusion that are also interpretable in terms of selective isotopic (and chemical) exchange between a mafic liquid reservoir from which the cumulates formed and overlying crust-derived granophyric melt. Based on the magnitude of Sr-Nd isotopic decoupling, they estimated a crystallization time of--•10 4 years for the uppermost cycle unit of the intrusion. Similarly, based on the extent of equilibration of Sr and Nd isotopic compositions and the length scale of heterogeneities (&lt;1 m) in the zones of commingling within the macrodike chamber, Blichert-Toft et al. [1992] estimate that the observed mingling and hybridization occurred during a few thousand years following magma emplacement in the upper crust, prior to significant crystallization. During this relatively brief phase in the magmatic history, selectively modified granophyre buoyantly segregated to the roof of the chamber to form a stratified system. These rocks are preserved in the roof zone of the Vandfaldsdalen macrodike [Blichert-Toft et al., 1992; Geist and White, 1994].</figDesc></figure>
