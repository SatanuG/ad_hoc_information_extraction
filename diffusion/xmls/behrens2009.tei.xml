<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Knowledge of element diffusion in silicate melts is pre-requisite for understanding and modeling magmatic processes such as the dissolution and the growth of crystals, melt/rock interactions, mixing and differentiation of magmas, and partitioning of elements and isotopes between coexisting phases (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Lasaga, 1982;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Ghiorso, 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Zhang et al., 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Trial and Spera, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Baker, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Lesher, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">LaTourette et al., 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Snyder and Tait, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr">Mungall, 2002a)</ref>. Numerous diffusion data have been determined in the past for cations in natural silicate melts in particular for anhydrous systems (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Hofmann, 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Watson and Baker, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Lowry et al., 1982;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Lesher, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Brady, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Chakraborty, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">LaTourette et al., 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Snyder and Tait, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Mungall et al., 1999)</ref>. Dissolved water is known to considerably enhance transport in silicate melts, but few diffusion studies have been performed on hydrous melts so far (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Baker, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Chekhmir and Epel'baum, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Watson, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Mungall et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Koepke and Behrens, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Hahn et al., 2005)</ref>. The main reason for the lack of such studies is the difficulty in controlling the water content of the melt and the need of high pressure to dissolve water contents in the order of weight percent in the melts.</p><p>The major aim of the present study is to improve our knowledge of cation diffusion in silicate melts by extending the compositional range towards potassium-rich trachytic and phonolitic melts. Such alkalirich melts can be formed by differentiation of alkali-basalts and play an important role in explosive volcanism. As base compositions we have selected a trachyte from the Phlegrean Fields (Italy) and a phonolite from the Laacher See Tephra (Germany). Both localities are characterized by complex magma systems with large variation in magma differentiation (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Schmincke, 1977;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Wörner and Schmincke, 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Melluso et al., 1995)</ref>. An important question is how fast the isotope and trace element signatures of phases in such magmas can adopt to changing conditions during magma differentiation. Knowledge of element diffusivities in the melt can help to clarify whether the measured element and isotope concentrations in minerals and glass represent kinetic or equilibrium fractionation during magma evolution. Thus, diffusion data are useful tools to reconstruct the history of the rocks.</p><p>A second objective of the multi-element diffusion study is to gain new insights into the structure of silicate melts. The simultaneous measurement of concentration profiles of elements in diffusion samples using synchrotron radiation X-ray fluorescence microanalysis (µ-SRXRF) allows even small differences in diffusivity to be resolved with high precision (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Hahn et al., 2005)</ref>. The diffusivity of cations is strongly related to their incorporation in the melt structure. Important parameters controlling the mobility of cations are ionic charge and ionic radius <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Jambon, 1982;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Roselieb and Jambon, 1997)</ref>, but tendency for formation of complexes (e.g., in the case of transition elements) affects the mobility as well. Comparison of the diffusivity of heterovalent elements such as europium (Eu 2+ vs. Eu 3+ ), iron (Fe 2+ vs. Fe 3+ ) and tin (Sn 2+ vs. Sn 4+ ) with those of univalent elements may provide information on the oxidation state of the elements and on the redox state of magmas in general <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Koepke and Behrens, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Hahn et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Behrens and Haack, 2007)</ref>.</p><p>The third impact of our study is on the rheological properties of melts. It has been shown in numerous studies that the Eyring equation</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">D = kdT λdη<label>ð1Þ</label></formula><p>is suitable to link melt viscosity to the diffusivity of network formers in silicate melts <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Baker, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Chakraborty, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Lesher et al., 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Poe et al., 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Mungall et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Reid et al., 2001)</ref>. Here k is the Boltzmann constant, λ is the characteristic jumping distance, and η is viscosity. The underlying idea is that the same transition state is passed during viscous flow and diffusion of network formers <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Glasstone et al., 1941;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Chakraborty, 1995)</ref>. The approach works successfully for diffusion of silicon and aluminium and in dry melts for oxygen diffusion as well <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Chakraborty, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Poe et al., 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Reid et al., 2001)</ref>. In hydrous melts oxygen can be transported via H 2 O molecules as carriers, as shown by 18 O tracer diffusion experiments with rhyolitic melts <ref type="bibr">(Behrens et al., 2007)</ref>. In that case oxygen diffusion is much faster than predicted by the Eyring equation, since oxygen diffusion is decoupled from the network relaxation which controls viscous flow of the melt. Thus, the comparison of the element diffusivity with the Eyring diffusivity provides information about how strongly the migration of elements is influenced by the dynamics of the silicate network. While relatively small monovalent cations such as Na + are only weakly affected by the silicate composition and structure (see for instance the diffusion data compilation in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Frischat, 1975)</ref>, the migration of high-field strength elements (HFSE) is strongly controlled by the network relaxation. Thus, the diffusivity of highly charged trace elements such as Zr 4+ may be used as a tool for the prediction of melt viscosities. Good agreement between experimentally measured zirconium diffusivity and the diffusivity calculated by the Eyring relationship were found for several melt compositions including rhyolite <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Mungall et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Hahn et al., 2005)</ref>, andesite <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Koepke and Behrens, 2001)</ref> and soda lime silicate melt <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Behrens and Haack, 2007)</ref>. Furthermore, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Baker (1990)</ref> demonstrated good correla-tion between the diffusion of Zr and the Eyring prediction for interdiffusion of rhyolite and dacite melts. In order to quantify the characteristic jumping distance λ linking Zr-diffusion and viscosity for trachytic and phonolitic melts, we have performed falling sphere experiments with the same melt compositions as used to study trace element diffusivity.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Starting materials</head><p>Obsidian from the basal unit of the Breccia Museo deposit in the Phlegrean Fields (Italy) was selected as base composition for the trachyte <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Ricci, 2000)</ref>. The same trachyte labelled as OSS ZAC has been used in a study on water solubility by Di <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Matteo et al. (2004)</ref>. The phonolite composition corresponds to the whole rock composition of the Upper Laacher See tephra (sample labelled as 1060 ULST in <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Wörner and Schmincke, 1984)</ref>. This is the latest, less differentiated product of the 12900 years B.P. eruption of the Laacher See volcano <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Schmincke, 1977)</ref>. Phase relationships for the storage conditions in the magma chamber before eruption have been studied experimentally by <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Berndt et al. (2001)</ref>.</p><p>The natural rocks contain significant amounts of trace elements which may complicate the resolution of trace element profiles after diffusion experiments (see below). Therefore we have used synthetic glasses as starting materials which were produced by melting of mixtures of oxides (SiO 2 , TiO 2 , Al 2 O 3 , Fe 2 O 3 , MgO) and carbonates (CaCO 3 , Na 2 CO 3 , K 2 CO 3 ) in a platinum crucible at 1600 °C in a chamber furnace for 3 h. To improve the homogeneity, the glass obtained after quenching the crucible in liquid water was crushed and re-melted twice at the same conditions. Compositions of the final base glasses are given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. In both the trachyte and the phonolite the atomic ratio of Na/K is 1.14. The ratio of non-bridging oxygen over tetrahedral cations (NBO/T) is close to zero for both anhydrous melts. In the calculation of NBO/T we used the Fe 2+ /Fe total ratios reported in Tables 2a-d and assume that Fe 3+ is a network former and Fe 2+ is a network modifier.</p><p>The base glass was crushed to b200 µm and split into three fractions. One fraction was directly used to produce trace element free samples for diffusion and viscosity experiments. The second fraction    <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Ricci, 2000)</ref> in the Phlegrean Fields (Italy).  <ref type="bibr">(1984)</ref>. Composition was measured by X-ray fluorescence analyses. was mixed with oxides, carbonates or chlorides of trace elements belonging to the groups of low field strength elements (LFSEs: Rb, Sr, Ba) also named large ion lithophiles, rare earth elements (REEs: Y, La, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Yb), main group elements (MGEs: Sn) and high field strength elements (HFSEs: Zr, Nb, Hf). The third fraction was doped with oxides of transition elements (TEs: Cr, Ni, Co, Zn). Separation of transition elements from the other trace elements is required because the K-peaks of TEs overlap with L-peaks of REEs and heavy HFSEs in the fluorescence spectra used for trace element profiling <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Hahn et al., 2005)</ref>. Nominal concentrations of 500 ppm for Hf and Yb and 300 ppm for the other trace elements were sufficient to get good peak intensities in fluorescence spectra. The mixtures of glass powder plus trace elements were melted again at 1600 °C for 3 h. After quenching the doped glasses were crushed to b200 µm to serve as starting materials for the syntheses of glass cylinders for diffusion experiments.</p><p>In order to investigate the effect of the redox state of the melt on trace element diffusion, part of each glass powder was mixed with 2 wt.% of graphite powder and heated in a graphite crucible for 30 min at 1300 °C in Ar/7%H 2 atmosphere. In this way the Fe 2+ /Fe tot ratio could be strongly increased (Tables <ref type="table">2a-d</ref>). The resulting glass spheres (~10 mm in diameter) were optically very inhomogeneous, as the glasses were reduced at non-equilibrium conditions. Metallic iron becomes the stable iron species at such reducing conditions which was indeed observed as a highly reflecting film on the produced glass spheres. However, electron microprobe analyses give evidence that the total iron content of the glass was not significantly lowered by reduction. The glass spheres were crushed as well for syntheses of diffusion samples.</p><p>In order to produce the glass cylinders for diffusion and viscosity experiments, glass powder (plus distilled H 2 O in case of hydrous glasses) was filled into Au 80 Pd 20 tubes (4-5 mm inner diameter, 0.2 mm wall thickness, 20-25 mm length) and compacted with a steel piston. After being welded shut the capsules were processed in an internally heated gas pressure vessel (IHPV) at 1250 °C and 500 MPa. Argon is used as the pressure medium and the hydrogen fugacity in the vessel is typically ~0.2 bar under these conditions resulting in an oxygen fugacity close to that buffered by the MnO-Mn 3 O 4 (MMO) assemblage if pure H 2 O fluid is present in the capsule <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Berndt et al., 2002)</ref>. In our experiments the water content in the capsules is much lower than the saturation value and, therefore, the conditions are more reducing than the MMO buffer.</p><p>Durations of 5 h were used for the synthesis of oxidized samples to achieve good chemical homogeneity while shorter periods of 0.5 h were applied for reduced glasses in order to minimize iron loss to the capsule walls. Syntheses were terminated by switching off the heating power of the furnace in the IHPV while maintaining constant pressure by automatic pumping. Initial cooling rates were about 200 K/min.</p><p>The glasses after the high pressure syntheses were very brittle and could not be separated from the capsule walls without breaking. Thus, cylinders were cut directly from the capsules (3-5 mm in length for the diffusion experiments, 10 mm in length for the viscosity samples). Residual glass was subjected to various analytical methods or crushed for preparation of viscosity samples. The homogeneity of trace elements could not be directly measured for each synthesized glass due to the restricted beamtime at the synchrotron facility. Profiles recorded in the part of the samples that were not affected by the diffusion indicate good homogeneity. However, these measurements evidence homogeneity only for elements displaying short diffusion profiles, otherwise these regions have been re-homogenized during the experiments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Diffusion experiments</head><p>Diffusion samples consist of three glass cylinders with polished base planes. The central cylinder (length 4-5 mm) was made from the undoped glass; the two others (length 2-3 mm) were doped either with TEs (A) or with REEs, LFSEs, HFSEs and Sn (B). Thus, two diffusion couples are combined in a single experiment with the central part being shared by both doped glasses. Further on we will denote this assemblage as a diffusion triple. The triple is sealed in an Au 80 Pd 20 capsule with 5 mm inner diameter. Before starting the diffusion experiments the capsules were compressed at room temperature in a steel autoclave at 40-50 MPa to squeeze the capsule which serves also as a test for possible leakage. Care was taken to avoid misfits between capsule and sample assemblage to avoid any free space in the capsule which may initiate melt flow during diffusion experiments. The diffusion experiments were carried out in the IHPV using the same procedure as for syntheses. After the experiment two sections were cut along the cylinder axis and polished on both sides. One section with thickness of ~250 µm was used for measurement of profiles of major oxides by electron microprobe and water content by FTIR microspectroscopy. The second section with thickness of 30-50 µm was analyzed by synchrotron X-ray fluorescence microanalysis. The residual glass was used for determination of the Fe 2+ /Fe total ratio after the experiment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Viscosity experiments</head><p>Viscosity samples were prepared as described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Vetere et al. (2006</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Vetere et al. ( , 2008))</ref>. A layer of Pt powder (grain size of b1 µm) was placed between a lower short cylinder (3 mm in length) and an upper long cylinder (~10 mm in length) as a reference for distance measurements. This assemblage was inserted into an Au 80 Pd 20 capsule with a flat base and a platinum sphere was loaded on top in the centre of a 2-3 mm high column of glass powder. After welding shut, a short term preexperiment was performed in order to fix the starting position of the sphere before the viscosity experiment. X-ray images were recorded at the Medical University (MH) of Hannover to visualize the sphere position in the non-transparent glasses. Measurement conditions were made with a SIEMENS HELIODENT DS X-ray camera with voltage of 60 kV and anode current of 7 mA, KODAK INSIGHT IP-21 film, and an exposure time of 0.16 s <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Vetere et al., 2008)</ref>. In order to improve the transmittance for X-ray radiation, part of the capsule wall was removed from the sides of the capsules.</p><p>The need to preserve at least part of the capsule to insure sufficient stability of the brittle samples limits the number of experiments which could be performed with the same sample. Usually we were able to run only one pre-experiment and one regular viscosity experiment with the same sample. For a new experiment the sample was sealed again in an Au 80 Pd 20 capsule. The viscosity η is calculated by Stokes law</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">η = 2dtd gdΔρd r 2 d C F 9d d<label>ð2Þ</label></formula><p>where d is the settling distance, t is the run duration, Δρ is the density difference between the sphere and the melt, g is the acceleration due to gravity (9.81 m/s 2 ), r is the radius of the sphere and C F is the Faxen correction <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Faxen, 1923)</ref> to account for the effect of viscous drag by the capsule wall on the settling sphere. In the calculation we have used the density of the glasses (see below) and the density of platinum (21.45 g/ cm 3 ) at room temperature instead of the densities at high P-T, but the effect on η is estimated to be less than 3% <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Vetere et al., 2006)</ref>. A correction of run duration to account for movement of spheres during heating and cooling was not necessary because the time correction amounts to only 40-60 s for the conditions employed in our experiments, which is negligible compared to the dwell at high P-T (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">4</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Analytical techniques</head><p>Concentrations of major oxides were determined by electron microprobe Cameca SX100. Measurement conditions were made using a defocused beam of 15 µm diameter, an accelerating voltage of 15 kV and a beam current of 4 nA.</p><p>Diffusion profiles of the trace elements were measured by synchrotron radiation X-ray fluorescence microanalysis at beamline L of the Hamburger Synchrotron-Strahlungslabor (HASYLAB) at Deutsches Elektronen Synchrotron (DESY) in Hamburg, Germany. Technical details are described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Hahn et al. (2005)</ref>. In that paper it was demonstrated as well that for most of the elements used in our study, profiling by µ-SRXRF is in excellent agreement with secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) and laser ablation coupled with optical emission spectrometry (LA-OES).</p><p>A cylindrical glass capillary working as a collimator was used to reduce the diameter of the incoming beam, resulting in a lateral resolution of b20 μm. An Al-Absorber of 0.5-4 mm thickness was utilized to depress the intense K-lines of the major elements. Fluorescence signals were recorded using an energy-dispersive high-purity germanium semiconductor detector (HPGe; 30 mm active diameter; 5 mm active thickness). The acquisition time was 240 s for each analysis (counting time of 170-180 s + dead time of the detector of 60-70 s).</p><p>An advantage of µ-SRXRF is that the fluorescence peaks of all elements in the sample can be measured simultaneously during the acquisition of a single spectrum. However, as noted above a severe problem can be the superimposition of peaks so that individual peaks might not be reliably resolved. This is the case in particular for the transition elements (overlap of their K-lines to L-lines of the REEs and HFSEs). However, by separating the TEs from the REEs and HFSEs this can be avoided.</p><p>The obtained fluorescence spectra were fitted with the AXIL X-ray analysis software <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(van Espen et al., 1977)</ref>. The intensities of all elements were normalized, employing K or Fe as an internal standard to eliminate fluctuations due to variations in the synchrotron beam intensity. Normalization allows correction of effects caused by variations in sample thickness and dead time of the detector.</p><p>Bulk water contents of hydrous glasses were measured by Karl-Fischer titration after thermal dehydration <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Behrens et al., 1996)</ref>. Raw data were corrected by adding 0.10 wt.% to account for unextracted water in glasses after heating <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Leschik et al., 2004)</ref>. Water contents of nominally dry glasses and water distribution in post-experimental samples were detected by IR-microspectroscopy. Absorption spectra of doubly polished glass slabs with thickness of 0.05-0.30 mm were recorded using an IR microscope Bruker IRscopeII connected to an FTIR spectrometer Bruker IFS88. Measurements were made using a globar light source, a KBr beam splitter and a narrow range MCT detector. 50-100 scans were accumulated for each spectrum with a spectral resolution of 2 cm -1 . The analyzed sample area was limited in the focal plane to ≈50 × 200 µm 2 using a slit aperture between the objective and the detector. Water contents were determined by the Lambert-Beer law from the peak height of the OH stretching vibration band at 3550 cm -1 after subtraction of a linear baseline:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">C W = 1801:5dA 3550 ρddde 3550<label>ð3Þ</label></formula><p>where C W is the total H 2 O content (wt.%), ρ is the density of the glass (g/L), d the thickness of the section (cm) and ε 3550 is the linear molar absorption coefficient (L mol -1 cm -1 ) sometimes referred to as the molar absorptivity or the extinction coefficient. Using sets of hydrous glasses pre-analyzed by KFT, the absorption coefficients were experimentally determined to be 66.9 ± 5.8 L mol -1 cm -1 for trachyte and 67.9 ± 4.1 L mol -1 cm -1 for phonolite. The density as a function of water content can be expressed as ρ = 2457 -24.0 • C W (trachyte) and ρ = 2512 -11.4 • C W (phonolite) in the range of water contents of 0-5 wt.%. These data were used to evaluate the IR absorption spectra of the glasses.</p><p>The proportion of ferrous iron in post-experimental glasses was measured using a modified colorimetric technique that is described in detail in <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Schuessler et al. (2008)</ref>. A quantity of 5-10 mg of glass was decomposed in an HF-H 2 SO 4 solution in the presence of excess pentavalent vanadium, which oxidizes ferrous iron as soon as it is released from the sample. After complete sample dissolution ferrous iron is regenerated from tetravalent vanadium by increasing the pH value to ~5. The regenerated Fe 2+ forms a very stable complex with 2:2′bipyridyl in the solution, which shows an intensive absorption band in the visible spectrum.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Results and discussion</head><p>The run products of the diffusion and viscosity experiments were always bubble-free and crystal-free glasses. No significant change in shape was observed after diffusion experiments supporting the assumption that the experiments were not affected by any oriented flux of melt. Further evidence for the absence of transport mechanisms other than diffusion is given by sharp and planar contacts between the different parts of the diffusion triple after the run. In particular, in the oxidized glasses the dark green doped glass can be clearly distinguish from the light brown undoped glass in thin sections. Finally, the large variation in diffusivity within the set of trace elements gives additional support that the experiments are controlled by diffusion rather than by convection.</p><p>An example of variations of concentrations of major oxides along the trace element diffusion profiles is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>. No significant variation in concentrations was observed in most of the experiments except for H 2 O. However, the different constituents of the diffusion triples had to be prepared individually. Thus, in some of the diffusion samples we observed up to 2 wt.% variation in SiO 2 and Al 2 O 3 while for the other elements the variation was always within analytical error. Variations in C W originate from slightly different water contents in the starting materials. However, water diffusion is much faster than cation diffusion in aluminosilicate melts <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Zhang and Behrens, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Freda et al., 2003)</ref> and relative variation of water content in the diffusion region was always within ±10%. Thus trace element diffusion occurs in a quasi-homogeneous medium. When using reduced glasses as starting materials part of the iron is lost to the capsule walls with concomitant relative increases in concentration for the other elements, which is visible in particular for SiO 2 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>). SiO 2 is the main component, therefore the absolute effect is more pronounced than for other oxide components. In the centre where the diffusion profiles are measured the initial iron content was still preserved and the diameter of the region that was not affected by iron loss was always smaller than the diffusion length for all trace elements except for the LFSEs in run PR1. However, the LFSEs are not strongly influenced by the redox state of the melt (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>) and, therefore, we included these elements in our data set as well (Table <ref type="table">2c</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Evaluation of diffusion profiles</head><p>Selected trace element profiles in two diffusion triples are displayed in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> with the TEs doped part A on the left and the REEs, HFSEs, LFSEs and Sn doped part B on the right. The graph clearly shows the problems with the separation of the fluorescence peaks of the transition elements. An apparent signal of Ni is measured in the undoped phonolite and trachyte glass originating from incomplete removal of background features close to the Ni K α -peak. At the transition to the trace element doped zone on the right side the Ni signal becomes less well resolved and the Ni profile shows large scatter. Even more severe is the influence of additional trace elements in the case of Zn where the measured signal displays a maximum near the contact between the undoped central part and the part doped with REEs, HFSEs, LFSEs and Sn. These findings clearly document the difficulties in quantification of the K-lines of TEs in fluorescence spectra of glasses with a multitude of trace elements. On the other hand, the apparent back ground intensity for the TE peaks in the undoped part of the triple does not disturb the determination of the diffusion coefficients because it is a constant value which can be simply subtracted. Elements other than the TEs show regular profiles with a continuous decrease in intensity from the doped to the undoped part of the diffusion samples. However, also for these elements the profiles sometimes show deviations from error function shape, e.g. the Zr profile in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref> may even suggest an uphilldiffusion. These deviations are mainly caused by superimposition of fluorescence peaks and by variations in the measurement conditions, i.e. the thin sections might be slightly bent and the synchrotron beam shows variation in intensity. Such effects cannot be completely removed even when using a major element as an internal standard. Additionally, small variations in major element composition between the different constituents of the diffusion sample may impose a chemical gradient which may affect trace element diffusion as well.</p><p>Such possible effects cannot be analyzed with our experiments due to the analytical difficulties. Specially designed experiments with a smaller set of trace elements and well adjusted major element gradients would be required to get more insight into such phenomena. Our main purpose was to quantify the diffusion coefficients and to detect small differences between trace elements. This was possible in all the spectra by analyzing the region around the interfaces.</p><p>If possible the duration of the experiments was adjusted so that the diffusion profiles reached neither the end of the corresponding doped cylinder nor the centre of the undoped cylinder. However, this could not be achieved in all experiments due to the large difference in diffusivity between slow elements such as Zr and fast elements such as Rb. In general we focus more on the determination of the slowly diffusing elements and thus in some experiments the Rb profile could not be evaluated because it was strongly affected by the boundaries of the diffusion sample.</p><p>Diffusion coefficients for trace elements were determined by fitting of the measured concentration-distance profiles to the appropriate solution of Fick's second law. Assuming concentrationindependent diffusion coefficients, the solution for one-dimensional diffusion between two semi-infinite media is <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Crank, 1975</ref>)</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">C x;t ð Þ -C 0 À Á C 1 -C 0 ð Þ = 1 2 1-erf x-a ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi 4Dt p<label>ð4Þ</label></formula><p>where C (x,t) is the concentration at distance x after time t, a is the position of the inflection point of the diffusion profile, C 0 and C 1 are the initial concentrations in both halves of the corresponding diffusion couple and D is the diffusion coefficient. This equation fits all profiles very well except for those of some TEs. Errors of the diffusion coefficients were calculated by error propagation considering the spatial resolution of the synchrotron beam (±10 µm), the uncertainty of the position of the x-y stage used for profiling (± 1 µm), the uncertainty of temperature (± 10 K), the uncertainty in run duration (±2 min) and the fit standard error specific for each profile.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Diffusion data</head><p>The diffusion data recorded in a single experiment cover a range between 1.4 log units (P7) to 2.9 log units (T6), see Tables 2a-d and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>. The diffusion patterns are similar to those observed in previous multi-element diffusion studies on andesitic and rhyolitic melts <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Koepke and Behrens, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Hahn et al., 2005)</ref>. The LFSEs Rb, Sr and Ba are always the fastest elements and the HFSEs the slowest elements within the set of trace elements used in our study (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). In most experiments the diffusivity of the TMs Zn and Ni is similar to that of the divalent LFSEs Sr and Ba. Both transition metals are commonly in the divalent state in silicate melts <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Brown et al., 1995)</ref>. The diffusivity of chromium is intermediate between those of the divalent LFSEs and the REEs, the latter ones being typically in the 3+ state except for europium which will be discussed separately. This finding is consistent with a recent X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectroscopic study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Berry et al. (2006)</ref> which shows that chromium occurs both as Cr 2+ and Cr 3+ at magmatic conditions.</p><p>Within the set of REEs the diffusivity systematically decreases with atomic number by 0.09 to 0.48 log units from La 3+ to Yb 3+ . Due to the lanthanide contraction the ionic radius of trivalent REEs decreases in the same order from 116 pm for La 3+ to 98.5 pm for Yb 3+ (ionic radii reported in this study are from <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Shannon (1976)</ref>. If not specified the values correspond to 8-fold coordination by oxygen). Europium generally diffuses faster than the other REEs because a significant portion is in the divalent state. The diffusivity of yttrium roughly follows the trend of the REEs. Typically Y diffusion is slower by ~0.1 log unit than La diffusion. Both elements are in the oxidation state 3+ in silicate melts at magmatic conditions and the ionic radius is smaller for Y 3+ (101.9 pm) than for La 3+ (116 pm). Diffusion of tin is up to one order of magnitude faster than Zr which is always in oxidation state 4+ under the conditions of our experiment. The fast diffusion of tin indicates a large fraction of Sn 2+ compared to Sn 4+ <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Linnen et al., 1996)</ref>.</p><p>The diffusivity of Nb in the trachytic and phonolitic melts is always faster than that of the Zr and Hf which have almost identical diffusivity. Similar diffusion pattern for these HFSEs was observed for andesitic melts run at comparable conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Koepke and Behrens, 2001)</ref>. Significantly faster diffusion of Nb compared to Zr was also observed in compositionally complex Cl-and F-bearing silicate melts <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Baker and Watson, 1988)</ref> and in rhyolite/dacite diffusion couples <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Baker, 1990)</ref>. The systematically higher diffusivity of Nb compared to Zr is difficult to rationalize from structural bonding.</p><p>Analyses of X-ray absorption fine structure show that zirconium is incorporated in silicate glasses as Zr 4+ mainly in 6-fold coordination <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Farges et al., 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Farges and Rossano, 2000)</ref>. No detectable coordination change around Zr sites upon heating to 1650 K was observed for sodium silicate glass melts <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Brown et al., 1995)</ref>. Niobium occurs solely as octahedrally coordinated Nb 5+ in silicate glasses <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Piilonen et al., 2005)</ref>. No spectroscopic evidence was found for Nb 3+ at intermediate oxygen fugacity conditions. The ratio of D Nb /D Zr is between 1.3 and 3.1 in the diffusion experiments with trachyte and phonolite except for run T3 with slightly higher ratio of 4.4. The insensitivity of D Nb /D Zr to water content and the redox state of iron (both parameters are directly coupled to oxygen fugacity) leads us to conclude that trivalent Nb cannot be the cause of the observed difference in diffusivity. Most likely, differences in metal-oxygen bond strengths between Nb-O and Zr-O are the reason for faster diffusion of Nb.</p><p>Although the set of diffusion data shows systematic trends, simple correlations to ionic radius and ionic charge are not evident. The diffusion is often slower for the transition elements Ni and Zn than for the LFSEs Sr and Ba. All these elements are in oxidation state 2+. Considering the smaller ionic radii of Ni 2+ (69 pm) and Zn 2+ (74 pm) compared to Sr 2+ (126 pm) and Ba 2+ (135 pm) one might expect an opposing trend (radii are for octahedral coordination here). The slow diffusion of the transition elements is probably due to the formation of strong bonds to oxygen.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Effect of redox conditions on trace element diffusion</head><p>A large variation in the redox state of the melt was adjusted through reduction of the starting glasses in a graphite crucible. This technique could be employed only to dry glasses since in hydrous glasses H 2 O acts as an oxidizing agent via the reaction 2 FeO(m) + H 2 O (m) =H 2 (g) + Fe 2 O 3 (m), where m indicates components dissolved in the melt and g denotes gaseous species. Hydrogen can escape during the experiment through the capsule walls into the gas pressure medium. The fraction of ferrous iron (Fe 2+ /Fe total ) ranges from 0.29 to 0.39 for oxidized melts and from 0.70 to 0.85 for reduced melts. The effect of the redox state of iron on diffusivity is rather small (b0.2 log units) for most of the elements in trachytic melts (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a</ref>). Exceptions are europium, tin and the HFSEs for which diffusion is noticeably enhanced by reduction of iron. In the cases of Sn and Eu this effect is easily explained by an increase of the fraction of 2+ cations. In the case of the HFSEs elements the increase in diffusivity might be due to a lowering of the melt viscosity. Ferrous iron behaves more like a network modifier while ferric iron is predominantly a network former <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Mysen and Richet, 2005)</ref>. Thus melt reduction decreases the polymerization of the aluminosilicate network and thus decreases the viscosity. Unfortunately we could not verify this hypothesis in the second experiment with the reduced trachyte (TR1) because the HFSE profiles could not be measured accurately in that experiment.</p><p>Results on phonolite melts appear to contrast with this hypothesis because diffusion of univalent cations was typically slightly faster in the oxidized melts than in the reduced melts (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3b</ref>). These differences, however, are within the experimental uncertainty and might be due to small differences in temperature and/or water content between the experiments. It is noteworthy that the trend is opposite for tin and europium which are typically faster in the reduced phonolite melts. Again, this observation indicates an increased fraction of divalent cations for these elements. A clear conclusion about the redox sensitivity of Cr diffusion is not possible on the basis of our experiments because of a lack of sufficient data (Tables <ref type="table">2a-d</ref>).</p><p>In the case of europium, the diffusivity data can be used to estimate the fraction of divalent cations in the melts <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Koepke and Behrens, 2001)</ref>. A basic assumption in this approach is that the local redox equilibrium of Eu is rapidly adjusted in the melt. This assumption is justified in trachytic and phonolitic melts because of the high concentration of iron. Electron transfer between iron and europium (Eu 2+ + Fe 3+ = Eu 3+ + Fe 2+ ) will rapidly commute Eu 2+ and Eu 3+ along the diffusion profile. Ionic radii of Eu 2+ (125 pm) and Sr 2+ (126 pm) are rather identical and Sr diffusion can serve as an equivalent of diffusion for Eu 2+ (radii are for 6-fold coordination). Diffusivity of Eu 3+ is expected to be the same as the average diffusivity of the neighbour REEs Gd and Sm (D Gd/Sm = (D Gd + D Sm ) / 2). Following this approach the fraction of Eu 2+ is given as <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Koepke and Behrens, 2001</ref>)</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">Eu 2+ Eu total = D Eu -D Gd=Sm D Sr -D Gd=Sm :<label>ð5Þ</label></formula><p>The calculated values are given in Tables 2a-d and are displayed in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>. At the same conditions (temperature, water content of the melt, redox state of iron) the Eu 2+ /Eu total is similar in trachyte and phonolite melts. In oxidized melts the fraction of divalent Eu is always less than 0.2 while in reduced melts it is larger than 0.3. In dry melts the relative abundance of Eu 2+ increases systematically with temperature. This trend is consistent with an entropy-driven reaction</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">Eu 2 O 3 ðmÞ⇔2EuOðmÞ þ 1=2O 2 ðgÞ:<label>ð6Þ</label></formula><p>An opposing trend is observed for hydrous melts. A possible explanation is that the redox reaction of europium is linked to the dissociation equilibrium of water. With increasing temperature the ratio of OH groups over molecular H 2 O increases in silicate melts <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Behrens and Gaillard, 2006)</ref>. If OH groups stabilize Eu 3+ , then reaction (6) will be shifted towards the left hand side. However, the trend for hydrous melts is not as robust and it might be overprinted by variations in water content. For instance in the experiments with hydrous phonolite the water content of melts increases in the same order as temperature does (Table <ref type="table">2d</ref>).</p><p>Unfortunately, an analog treatment to estimate the redox state of the other heterovalent elements Cr and Sn is not possible due to a lack of reliable estimates of the diffusion coefficients of the different cations. In reduced trachyte melts Sn diffusivity is close to that of Zn and Ni implying that Sn 2+ is predominant at these conditions. On the other hand, in oxidized trachyte melts Sn diffusivity is 0.3-1.1 log units slower than Zn and Ni diffusivities which indicate a large fraction of slowly diffusing Sn 4+ . In dry phonolite melts no significant difference in diffusivity between Sn and divalent transition elements was found for either oxidized or reduced melts. Again we conclude that Sn 2+ is predominant at these conditions. By contrast, in hydrous phonolite D Sn is more than half an order of magnitude smaller than D Ni and D Zn . These observations can be explained by the oxidizing effect of dissolved water.</p></div>

A common trend is that the activation energy increases with the charge of cations, e.g. in dry phonolite from 177 kJ/mol for Rb + to 365 kJ/mol for Zr 4+ (Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>). When adding water E a is lowered significantly for all elements, consistent with findings in previous studies on trace element diffusion in granitic melts <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Mungall et al., 1999)</ref>.</p><p>The Eu diffusivity in dry trachytic melts is relatively high at 1150 °C (run T10) compared to other temperatures while the data for other REEs are consistent over the whole temperature range (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6b</ref>). The reason for this discrepancy is not known but most likely it is due to an analytical problem. When ignoring this datum, the trends for Eu diffusion in trachyte and phonolite are in fairly good agreement (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6b</ref> and<ref type="figure">e</ref>). In dry melts the deviation in diffusivity between Eu and the other REEs decreases with temperature while it increases in wet melts. As a consequence the activation energy for diffusion of Eu is larger than that of the other REEs in dry melts while it is smaller in wet melts. These trends reflect the changes in relative abundance of Eu 2+ displayed in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>. In the case of heterovalent elements such as europium the activation energy for diffusion is not only determined by the energetic barrier for elemental jumps but also by temperatureinduced changes in the fraction of the more mobile species (i.e. the cation with lower charge).

Thus the experimental data are directly comparable.</p><p>Although small differences in water contents between the studied melts may affect the conclusions, there are nevertheless some clear trends in the data sets. In general the diffusivity is much slower in rhyolite than in trachyte and phonolyte. For LFSEs the difference is between 0.3 and 0.7 log units while for HFSEs it approaches even 1.5 log units (in the case of Nb). On the other hand, the difference in diffusivity between trachyte and phonolite is much smaller. For the plotted data set it is at most 0.6 log units (in the case of Nb). A common explanation for such a compositional trend is a variation in the degree of melt polymerization expressed as the ratio NBO/T. However, NBO/T is close to zero for all three anhydrous compositions implying complete polymerization.</p><p>The most pronounced changes along the pseudo-join rhyolitephonolite are related to the concentrations of alkalis and alkaline earth elements.

The diffusivities of REEs and the HFSEs vary almost linearly with M/O while the data for the LFSEs show no systematic trend (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8b</ref>).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Conclusions</head><p>Diffusivities of a large set of trace elements belonging to different chemical groups (LFSE, TE, REE, HFSE, MGE) were measured for trachytic and phonolitic melts. Trace element diffusivities increase continuously from rhyolite to trachyte and phonolite. This variation is attributed to the increase in the degree of melt depolymerization expressed as NBO/T and to the increasing abundance of alkali and alkaline earth elements in these melts. The addition of water to dry melts increases the diffusivity of all elements, consistent with previous studies on element diffusion in silicate melts.</p><p>The redox state of iron in the melt expressed as Fe 2+ /Fe total has a strong influence on the diffusivity of heterovalent elements (Eu, Sn) while other elements are only weakly affected. The enhancement of diffusion of Eu, Cr, Sn by an increased fraction of ferrous iron is attributed to the stabilization of low-charged cations. In the case of europium, which is present as Eu 2+ and Eu 3+ in silicate melts, the fraction of divalent europium could be estimated by comparison of the diffusivity of Eu with those of Sr (analogue of Eu 2+ ) and neighbouring REEs Sm and Gd (analogues of Eu 3+ ).</p><p>Additional measurement of the viscosities of trachyte and phonolite melts under the same experimental conditions as used in trace element diffusion experiments enables us to evaluate the effect of structural relaxation of silicate networks on the mobility of trace elements. The diffusivities of HFSEs are close to the Eyring diffusivity calculated from viscosity when assuming a jumping distance of ~0.5 nm. Diffusitivies of the LFSEs Rb, Sr and Ba, on the other hand, are up to three orders of magnitude faster implying only weak coupling to melt relaxation. Empirical relationships for the prediction of trace element diffusivities derived by <ref type="bibr">Mungall (2002b)</ref> were found to be suitable only for rough estimation of trace element diffusivities in trachytic and phonolitic melts. Such calculation schemes might be improved using the new data sets presented in our study.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
