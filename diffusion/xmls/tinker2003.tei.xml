<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Self-diffusion coefficients for Si and O in Di 58 An 42 liquid were measured from 1 to 4 GPa and temperatures from 1510 to 1764°C. Glass starting powders enriched in 18 O and 28 Si were mated to isotopically normal glass powders to form simple diffusion couples, and self-diffusion experiments were conducted in the piston cylinder device (1 and 2 GPa) and in the multianvil apparatus (3.5 and 4 GPa). Profiles of 18 O/ 16 O and 29,30 Si/ 28 Si were measured using secondary ion mass spectrometry. Self-diffusion coefficients for O (D(O)) are slightly greater than self-diffusion coefficients for Si (D(Si)) and are often the same within error. For example, D(O) ϭ 4.20 Ϯ 0.42 ϫ 10 Ϫ11 m 2 /s and D(Si) ϭ 3.65 Ϯ 0.37 ϫ 10 Ϫ11 m 2 /s at 1 GPa and 1662°C. Activation energies for self-diffusion are 215 Ϯ 13 kJ/mol for O and 227 Ϯ 13 kJ/mol for Si. Activation volumes for self-diffusion are Ϫ2.1 Ϯ 0.4 cm 3 /mol and Ϫ2.3 Ϯ 0.4 cm 3 /mol for O and Si, respectively. The similar self-diffusion coefficients for Si and O, similar activation energies, and small, negative activation volumes are consistent with Si and O transport by a cooperative diffusion mechanism, most likely involving the formation and disassociation of a high-coordinated intermediate species. The small absolute magnitudes of the activation volumes imply that Di 58 An 42 liquid is close to a transition from negative to positive activation volume, and Adam-Gibbs theory suggests that this transition is linked to the existence of a critical fraction (ϳ0.6) of bridging oxygen.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Self-diffusion and viscous flow properties of silicate liquids are determined by the bonding environments of silicon (Si) and oxygen (O). The transport of Si and O depends on pressure, and a number of experimental studies (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Shimizu and Kushiro, 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Poe et al., 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Tinker and Lesher, 2001)</ref>, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Nevins and Spera, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Bryce et al., 1999)</ref>, and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Liu et al., 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Stebbins and McMillan, 1989)</ref> have focused on the link between the transported species and liquid structure at high pressures. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Shimizu and Kushiro (1984)</ref> studied O self-diffusion in jadeite melt and diopside melt and reported that O self-diffusion coefficients increased with pressure from 0.5 to 2 GPa in polymerized jadeite melt and decreased with pressure from 1 to 1.7 GPa in depolymerized diopside melt. The positive pressure dependence for O self-diffusion in jadeite melt corresponds to a negative activation volume, which <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Shimizu and Kushiro (1984)</ref> interpreted as reflecting a collapse of the melt structure. In contrast, the negative pressure dependence for O self-diffusion in diopside corresponds to a positive activation volume, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Shimizu and Kushiro (1984)</ref> interpreted this as reflecting expansion of the melt structure. In a more recent study, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Shimizu and Kushiro (1991)</ref> studied Si self-diffusion in compositions along the diopside-jadeite join and found a transition from positive to negative pressure dependence of self-diffusion near Di 30 Jd 70 (mol.%) (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>). A corollary of this result is the fact that the activation volume for Si self-diffusion is vanishingly small for Di 30 Jd 70 liquid at 1 GPa.</p><p>The data summarized in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> show that changes in liquid structure (e.g., NBO/T) are accompanied by changes in activation volume controlling self-diffusion. These structural changes may be analogous to changes in structure occurring during compression of a single liquid composition. In some polymerized liquid compositions, self-diffusion coefficients increase on initial compression, reach maximum values, and then decrease with increasing pressure. Activation volumes in these liquids go from negative to positive, similar to the activation volumes calculated for decreasingly polymerized liquids in the Di-Jd system. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Tinker and Lesher (2001)</ref> reported experimental results showing that both Si and O self-diffusion coefficients have maxima at roughly 5 GPa in dacitic liquid. Similarly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Poe et al. (1997)</ref> observed maximum self-diffusion coefficients for O in albitic (at 5 GPa) and Na 3 AlSi 7 O 17 (at 8 GPa) liquids. Maximum self-diffusion coefficients near 30 GPa were predicted in early MD simulations for O self-diffusion in jadeite liquid <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Angell et al., 1982)</ref>. More recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Nevins and Spera (1998)</ref> predicted maximum self-diffusion coefficients for Si and O near 5 GPa in a MD simulation study of anorthite (CaAlSi 2 O 8 ) liquid, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Bryce et al. (1999)</ref> predicted maximum self-diffusion coefficients for Si, Al, and O at 21 GPa in nepheline, jadeite, and albite liquids at 5000 K. Conversely, in depolymerized compositions, self-diffusion coefficients for O can reach minimum values with increasing pressure. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Reid et al. (2001)</ref> conducted an experimental study of Si and O selfdiffusion in diopside liquid between 3 and 15 GPa and reported minimum self-diffusion coefficients for both Si and O at 11 GPa.</p><p>The goal of the present study is to improve our understanding of the transition from negative to positive activation volume. There are no previous experimental studies of O selfdiffusion in intermediate compositions along compositional joins, so we have chosen to measure Si and O self-diffusion coefficients in the 1 atm eutectic composition 58 wt.% diop-side-42 wt.% anorthite (64 mol.% Di-36 mol.% An) liquid (Di 58 An 42 ). The Di-An system is a good, simple analog for naturally occurring basalts and the viscosity <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Scarfe et al., 1983)</ref>, and O self-diffusion coefficients <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Dunn, 1982)</ref> have been measured in Di-An liquids at atmospheric pressure.</p><p>Here we report the results of laboratory measurements of the simultaneous self-diffusion of Si and O in Di 58 An 42 liquid from 1 to 4 GPa between 1510 and 1764°C. The new results of this study suggest that this liquid is near a compositional transition from positive to negative pressure dependence. The self-diffusion of Si and O in Di 58 An 42 liquid probably occurs through the formation of a high-coordinated intermediate species. We evaluate our results using a configurational entropy model for viscosity <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Adam and Gibbs, 1965)</ref> and suggest that the pressure dependence of Si and O self-diffusion depends on a critical fraction of nonbridging O in the liquid.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</head><p>Starting materials (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>) were synthesized from laboratory reagents following the methods described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Tinker and Lesher (2001)</ref>. Self-diffusion experiments were conducted at 1, 2, 3.5, and 4 GPa and between 1510 and 1764°C. Experiments at 1 and 2 GPa were performed in a 0.5-inch Boyd and England piston cylinder apparatus <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Boyd and England, 1960)</ref>, and the experiments at 3.5 and 4 GPa were performed in a Walker 6/8 multi-anvil device <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Walker et al., 1990)</ref>. The configuration of the experimental assembly, a description of pressure and temperature calibration of the experimental apparatus, and details of the experimental procedure are available in <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Tinker and Lesher (2001)</ref>.</p><p>Silicon and oxygen isotope gradients were measured using a modified Cameca IMS 3f ion microprobe at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. We used a primary ion beam of 16 O Ϫ accelerated to 12.5 or 15 KeV. The beam current was ϳ2 nA, and the beam was focused to yield a spot size of Յ 20 m. Negative secondary ions were accelerated to a nominal energy of 4500 eV and focused into the mass spectrometer operated at a mass resolving power of ϳ2800. This resolving power was sufficient to ensure 28 SiH Ϫ contributed Ͻ 0.2% of the 29 Si Ϫ intensity; 16 OH 2 Ϫ is fully separated from<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">18</ref> O Ϫ at this mass resolving power. The accelerating potential was offset by Ϫ30V (to 4470V) before each measurement of 16 O Ϫ to reduce the intensity below 1 ϫ 10 6 per second. Data were collected by stepping the magnet through the mass sequence 15.8, 16 (O), 18 (O), 28 (Si), 29 (Si), and 30 (Si) amu. Count times were 1 s for 16 O, 18 O, and 28 Si; 3 s for 29 Si; and 4 s for 30 Si. Secondary ion intensities were measured by pulse counting. Typical intensities (per second) for 28 Si, 29 Si, 30 Si, 16 O, and 18 O in the isotopically normal Di 58 An 42 composition were 30,000, 1500, 1000, 700,000, and 2000, respectively. In the isotopically enriched endmember composition, intensities (per second) for 28 Si, 29 Si, 30 Si, 16 O, and 18 O were 35,000, 1000, 650, 700,000, and 15,000, respectively. Diffusion profiles were calculated by determining the changes in O and Si isotope compositions as a function of position along traverses across the diffusion interface. Traverses typically consisted of 20 points, with a 50-to 60-m step size. The precision of isotope ratio measurements for each analysis was usually within a factor of 1.5 of the limit imposed by counting statistics and was typically ϳ0.4 to 0.5%. Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>. Variation of activation volume (ordinate) for Si self-diffusion with changes in the degree of polymerization of liquids (abscissa). The degree of polymerization is measured as the ratio of nonbridging oxygen to tetrahedral cation (NBO/T). Fully polymerized liquids have NBO/T ϭ 0 and completely depolymerized liquids have NBO/T ϭ 4 (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Mysen, 1990)</ref>. Activation volumes for Si self-diffusion in Di-Jd liquid compositions at 1550°C (filled triangles) decrease with increasing polymerization from endmember Di to Jd, and there is a transition from positive to negative activation volume at NBO/T ϭ 0.445 <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Shimizu and Kushiro, 1991)</ref>. Data from <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Shimizu and Kushiro (1991)</ref> are used to calculate the activation volumes for Si in Di (NBO/T ϭ 2) (2 cm 3 /mol), in Di 60 Jd 40 (mol.%, NBO/T ϭ 0.97) (2.9 cm 3 /mol), in Di 40 Jd 60 (NBO/T ϭ 0.59) (2.35 cm 3 /mol), in Di 20 Jd 80 (NBO/T ϭ 0.27) (Ϫ4.7 cm 3 /mol), and in Jd (NBO/T ϭ 0) (Ϫ13.4 cm 3 /mol). An alternative activation volume for Si self-diffusion in Di (3 cm 3 /mol, open triangle) is calculated using data from <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Reid et al. (2001)</ref>. For comparison, the activation volume for Si in dacitic liquid (diamond) is Ϫ8.7 cm 3 /mol at 1561°C, and the activation volume for Si in basaltic liquid (square) is Ϫ7.9 cm 3 /mol from 1 to 2 GPa between 1320 and 1600°C <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Lesher et al., 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Tinker and Lesher, 2001)</ref>. The activation volume for Si self-diffusion in Di 58 An 42 liquid (NBO/T ϭ 0.8) (filled circle) is Ϫ2.3 cm 3 /mol. Interpolation between Di 58 An 42 and Di suggests that the transition from positive to negative activation volume on the Di-An join occurs when NBO/T is between 1.2 and 1.4. No corrections for instrumental mass-dependent isotope fractionation were applied.</p></div>

Diffusion coefficients for Si and O are reported with an error of 10%, determined by the reproducibility of multiple transects with the ion microprobe. Errors on reported isotopic abundances at individual points represent the standard deviation of the mean for 20 measurements of each ratio. In addition to analytical errors, uncertainties in reported diffusion coefficients may be introduced by deformation of the experimental charge. Specifically, thermal expansion and isothermal compressibility during quenching and decompression of an experimental charge can affect the length of a diffusion profile.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Self-Diffusion Mechanism</head><p>The positive pressure dependence of Si and O self-diffusion can be explained by the formation and disassociation of fivecoordinated Si (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Liu et al., 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Farnan and Stebbins, 1994)</ref> or Al <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Poe et al., 1997)</ref> intermediate species. Five-coordinated Si has been inferred from NMR spectra of K 2 Si 4 O 9 glass cooled at various rates from 1300°C at atmospheric pressure <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Stebbins, 1991)</ref>, and five-and six-coordinated Si have been inferred from NMR spectra of K 2 Si 4 O 9 glass quenched from 1.9 GPa <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Stebbins and McMillan, 1989)</ref>. Increasing proportions of high-coordinated Al have been inferred from NMR spectra of Na 3 AlSi 7 O 17 quenched from pressures between 6 and 12 GPa, with the abundance of six-coordinated Al increasing continuously and the abundance of five-coordinated Al reaching a maximum at 8 GPa <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Yarger et al., 1995)</ref>. The self-diffusion of Si and O by the formation of highcoordinated Si or Al results in negative activation volumes with absolute magnitudes that are close to the molar volume of O (6.9 cm 3 /mol). Additional expectations for this type of ion exchange include similar Si and O self-diffusion coefficients and similar activation energies for Si and O self-diffusion. The new results for Si and O self-diffusion in Di 58 An 42 liquid are consistent with these expectations, although the absolute magnitudes of the activation volumes are slightly smaller than the molar volume of O.</p><p>When no more five-coordinated Si or Al can form, selfdiffusion coefficients reach maximum values. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Angell et al. (1982)</ref> predicted a maximum O self-diffusion coefficient in NaAlSi 2 O 6 liquid near 30 GPa, where the population of fivecoordinated Si reached its maximum.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Compositional Dependence of Activation Volume</head><p>Previous workers have compared the self-diffusion of Si and O in silicate liquids to the degree of polymerization of the liquids. The best example of such a comparison is reproduced in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>, which shows changes in the activation volumes for Si in Di-Jd liquids <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Shimizu and Kushiro, 1991)</ref> with variations in NBO/T. As discussed earlier, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Shimizu and Kushiro (1991)</ref> report that the transition from negative to positive activation volume in Di-Jd liquids occurs at NBO/T ϭ 0.445. For comparison, we plot activation volumes for Si in Di 58 An 42 liquid (NBO/T ϭ 0.8), for Si in dacitic liquid (NBO/T ϭ 0.1) at 1561°C (Ϫ8.7 cm 3 /mol), and for Si in basaltic liquid (NBO/T ϭ 0.9) between 1320 and 1600°C (Ϫ7.9 cm 3 /mol) <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Lesher et al., 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Tinker and Lesher, 2001)</ref>. Two activation volumes for Si self-diffusion in Di are plotted in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>. The activation volume of 2 cm 3 /mol, for pressures between 0.5 and 1.7 GPa at 1650°C, is from the piston cylinder experimental study of <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Shimizu and Kushiro (1991)</ref>. The activation volume of 2.9 cm 3 /mol, for pressures between 3 and 6 GPa at 2000°C, is from the recent multianvil study of <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Reid et al. (2001)</ref>. Interpolation between these activation volumes for endmember Di and the activation volume for Si in Di 58 An 42 (Ϫ2.1 cm 3 /mol) gives a range of NBO/T between 1.2 and 1.4 for the transition from negative to positive activation volume in Di-An liquids. The differences in the NBO/T values predicted for transitions in pressure dependence, along with the observation that the activation volume for Si self-diffusion in basaltic liquid lies well off the trends defined by the data for Di-Jd and Di-An liquids, suggest that there are liquid structural controls on Si selfdiffusion behavior that are not described well by the NBO/T index. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Shimizu and Kushiro (1991)</ref> proposed that the pressure effect on self-diffusion behavior of compositions along the Di-Jd join is caused by changes in melt subsystems, similar to the terminology of <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Adam and Gibbs (1965)</ref> who equated "subsystems" and "cooperatively rearranging regions" when they described the structural relaxation of liquids. Cooperatively rearranging regions can change their configurations independently of their surrounding environments. The existence of the subsystems envisioned by <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Shimizu and Kushiro (1991)</ref> accounts for configurational entropy that enhances self-diffusion of Si in intermediate compositions along the Di-Jd join.</p><p>There are no systematic studies of O self-diffusion along a compositional join, as are available for Si. However, there is an inverse relationship between the melt viscosity () and the O self-diffusion coefficient (D(O)) (e.g., in the Eyring equation ϭ kT/D(O), where k is the Boltzmann constant and is the characteristic jump distance for diffusion), which allows a comparison of the pressure dependence of melt viscosity and the pressure dependence of self-diffusion. The Eyring equation successfully predicts the sense of the pressure dependence of viscosities of depolymerized liquids such as Di (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Shimizu and Kushiro, 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Reid et al., 2001)</ref>, although it is unable to predict their magnitudes accurately. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Kushiro (1981)</ref> found a transition from negative to positive pressure dependence of viscosity near the anorthite composition in the CaAl 2 O 4 -SiO 2 system in which all liquids have NBO/T ϭ 0, while <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Brearley et al. (1986)</ref> found a viscosity minimum for Ab 25 Di 75 liquid (NBO/T ϭ 1.2) at roughly 1.2 GPa. For the Di-An system, the negative activation volume we determined for Di 58 An 42 melt (e.g., Ϫ2.1 cm 3 /mol) coupled with values for pure Di melts between 8.48 cm 3 /mol <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Shimizu and Kushiro, 1984)</ref> and 3 cm 3 /mol <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Reid et al., 2001)</ref> predicts by linear interpolation that the activation volume will be zero at an NBO/T between 1 and 1.3. Although this range brackets the NBO/T reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Brearley et al. (1986)</ref> for the change in the sign of ⌬V a in the Di-Ab system, it is clear from <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Kushiro's (1981)</ref> work on fully polymerized melts that NBO/T alone is not a reliable index for the sign of the activation volume. In the next section, we show how Adam-Gibbs theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Adam and Gibbs, 1965)</ref> can be used to unify the results for polymerized and depolymerized melts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Adam-Gibbs Theory</head><p>A relationship between melt viscosity and configurational entropy is derived from the probability of structural rearrangement of a liquid <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Adam and Gibbs, 1965)</ref>. The Adam-Gibbs theory results in an inverse relationship between the natural log of the viscosity () and configurational entropy (S conf ): ln ϭ A e ϩ B e /TS conf , where A e and B e are constants that depend mainly on composition (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Richet, 1984)</ref>. This relationship has been applied to viscosities of silicate liquids near the glass transition (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Bottinga et al., 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bottinga and Richet, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Toplis, 1998</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Toplis, , 2001))</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Bottinga and Richet (1995)</ref> modified the Adam-Gibbs theory to explain experimental results showing that viscosities of polymerized liquids decrease with pressure and viscosities of depolymerized liquids increase with pressure. They derived:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">ͫ Ѩln() ѨP ͬ T ϭ B e TS conf 2 ͫͫ ѨV conf ѨT ͬ P ϩ ͫ Ѩ ѨP ͬ T RN 0 In ͩ 1Ϫ ͪͬ (3)</formula><p>where V conf (defined as V liquid Ϫ V glass ) is the configurational volume, N 0 is the number of O atoms divided by the number of simple oxide moles per formula unit (e.g., N 0 ϭ 2 for NaAlSi 2 O 6 and N 0 ϭ 1.5 for CaMgSi 2 O 6 ), and is the fraction of bridging oxygen (BO) in the melt ( ϭ BO/total O). The critical term in Eqn. 3 is ln[/(1 Ϫ )], which is positive in polymerized liquids (where Ͼ 0.5) and negative in depolymerized liquids (where Ͻ 0.5). The change in sign with composition of this term is important, because the signs of the other terms in Eqn. 3 are constant for silicate liquids. First, B e and S conf are positive, so (B e /TS conf 2</p><p>) is positive. Second, because the coefficients of thermal expansion for silicate liquids are in general greater than those for the corresponding glasses <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Lange, 1997)</ref>, (ѨV conf /ѨT) P is positive for silicate liquids. Third, (Ѩ/ѨP) T is negative in silicate liquids because the partial molar volume of bridging oxygens is greater than the partial molar volume of nonbridging oxygens <ref type="bibr">(Bottinga and Richet, 1995)</ref>. Therefore, if the magnitude of the (ѨV conf /ѨT) P term is sufficiently small, the positive ln[/(1 Ϫ )] in polymerized liquids gives a negative pressure dependence of viscosity, and the negative ln[/(1 Ϫ )] in depolymerized liquids gives a positive pressure dependence of viscosity.</p><p>Recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Bryce et al.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.">Oxygen-Bonding Controls on Self-Diffusion</head><p>In this section, we examine the relationship between and ⌬V a for O self-diffusion in polymerized and depolymerized silicate liquid compositions. The application of Adam-Gibbs theory depends on the parameters used in Eqn. 5 (see Table <ref type="table">6</ref> for parameters used here). To determine the parameters in Eqn. 5, we make two important simplifications. First, we substitute dV/dT for (ѨV conf /ѨT) P , and we use molar oxide contributions from <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Lange (1997)</ref> to estimate dV/dT for liquids along the Di-An join. This substitution is justified because the thermal expansion of most silicate liquids is more than an order of magnitude greater than the thermal expansion of the same composition of silicate glass (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Lange, 1997)</ref>. Second, we treat Ѩ/ѨP as a constant independent of ln[/(1 Ϫ )]. Although this is an oversimplification of the behavior of silicate liquids, this approach allows us to constrain uniquely for a given liquid composition and ⌬V a .</p><p>In our initial calculations, we assign for Di and An liquids. We use ϭ 0.33 for Di, based on the stoichiometry <ref type="bibr">(Bottinga and Richet, 1995)</ref>, and we use ϭ 0.95 for An, based on MD simulations (5% NBO at P Ͻ 5 GPa; <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Nevins and Spera, 1998)</ref>.</p><p>The B e values for Di and An are from <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Richet (1984)</ref>. We calculate S conf following <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Richet et al. (1986)</ref>, using configurational entropy and heat capacity terms from <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Richet (1984)</ref>. For Di, we use ⌬V a ϭ 8.48 cm 3 /mol as reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Shimizu and Kushiro (1984)</ref>, because this piston cylinder study presents the lowest pressure experimental results available in the literature. For An, we use ⌬V a ϭ Ϫ3 cm 3 /mol, from MD simulations for 2 to 5 GPa <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Nevins and Spera, 1998)</ref>. Finally, we calculate Ѩ/ѨP for Di and An using Eqn. 5.</p><p>The parameters for Di 58 An 42 liquid in Eqn. 5 are determined by interpolating linearly between Di and An. We use contributions of endmember values in molar proportions (i.e., 36% of the An value summed with 64% of the Di value) to estimate S conf and B e for Di 58 An 42 liquid. To determine for Di 58 An 42 , we interpolate (with step sizes of 0.002) between values for Di and An, and we calculate dV/dT (in increments of 2 mol.%) for intermediate Di-An compositions <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Lange, 1997)</ref>. The value ϭ 0.84 for Di 58 An 42 is at the same incremental step between endmembers as dV/dT calculated for Di 58 An 42 . We use this correlation because dV/dT can be determined reliably for silicate liquids. As we did for Di and An, we calculate the value of Ѩ/ѨP for Di 58 An 42 .</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">5a</ref> shows the changes in and ⌬V a with increasing Di content in the liquid. The ⌬V a values for O self-diffusion in Di from <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Shimizu and Kushiro (1984)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Reid et al. (2001)</ref> are included in this plot to show the possible range of ⌬V a at low to moderate pressures. The most important feature of Figure <ref type="figure">5a</ref> is that An and Di 58 An 42 have similar values, and these values are much greater than for Di. The sharp decrease in between Di 58 An 42 and Di coincides with a transition from negative to positive ⌬V a . Interpolating between the two ⌬V a values for Di and the ⌬V a for Di 58 An 42 , we predict that the transition from positive to negative pressure dependence will occur in liquid compositions with 65 to 75 wt.% Di. These liquids have between 0.62 and 0.73. In other words, the Adam-Gibbs theory predicts that the transition from positive to negative ⌬V a will occur when 62 to 73% of oxygen in a Di-An liquid is bridging oxygen.</p><p>The Adam-Gibbs analysis can also be used to explore the relationship between and ⌬V a for Jd and Ab liquids in addition to Di-An liquids. This analysis evaluates changes in liquid structure due to compression of a constant liquid composition. Low pressure values of ⌬V a for O self-diffusion are those values reported in the literature for the lowest pressure ranges available. The for Jd and Ab liquids at low pressure are determined by interpolation between 0.33 (Di) and 0.95 (An). We choose values for that correspond to dV/dT calculated for Jd and Ab. The parameters for S conf and B e for Jd and Ab are from <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Richet (1984)</ref>, and we calculate Ѩ/ѨP using Eqn. 5. We estimate ⌬V a for O self-diffusion at high pressures using O self-diffusion coefficients in Ab from 4 to 6 GPa <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Poe et al., 1997)</ref> and Di from 3 to 6 GPa and 11 to 13 GPa <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Reid et al., 2001)</ref>. We allow only and ⌬V a to change with pressure. The change in liquid structure with pressure is measured by the change in necessary to reproduce ⌬V a using Eqn. 5. Table <ref type="table">6</ref> shows a list of all parameters used in Eqn. 5.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">5b</ref> shows the -⌬V a relationship for Di and Ab liquids with increasing pressure, the -⌬V a relationship for liquid compositions along the Di-An join, and the -⌬V a relationship for Jd liquid. There is a general trend of decreasing ⌬V a with increasing , and we use this trend to make a prediction of the pressure dependence of O self-diffusion in silicate liquids. The line running through the data is a least-squares-best-fit to all of the data. This line crosses ⌬V a ϭ 0 at Ϸ 0.6. Therefore, we expect transitions from positive to negative ⌬V a for O selfdiffusion when 60% of oxygen is bridging oxygen. This estimate is not precise because of scatter in the data. However, this scatter may be due to differences in diffusion mechanisms as O self-diffusion passes through a minimum or a maximum. For example, the -⌬V a relationship for depolymerized Di, in which O self-diffusion coefficients pass through a minimum, has a steep, negative trend. In contrast, a shallower trend is defined by the -⌬V a relationship for polymerized Ab, in which O self-diffusion coefficients pass through a maximum. To understand the differences in these -⌬V a relationships, more experimental work must be performed to determine the pressure dependence of O self-diffusion in depolymerized liquid compositions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">CONCLUSIONS</head><p>This study shows that the Adam-Gibbs theory is useful for understanding the relationship between melt structure () and activation volume for O self-diffusion. The new self-diffusion data for Di 58 An 42 liquid in this study allow a comparison of and ⌬V a for liquids along the Di-An join. The Adam-Gibbs analysis emphasizes similarities between transitions from positive to negative activation volume that are due to changes in liquid composition and the transitions from positive to negative activation volume that occur when liquids of constant composition are compressed. Both compositionally driven and pressure-induced transitions reflect silicate liquid structures with of 0.6 to 0.65. Similarities in the structures of liquids undergoing transitions from positive to negative activation volume are important experimentally. Detailed experimental and spectroscopic studies of silicate liquid compositions that have small activation volumes at low pressures may provide important information on the liquid structure controlling the dynamic behavior of liquids such as Ab and Di in which maximum and minimum self-diffusion coefficients have been observed at high pressures. Understanding these simple systems will further elucidate the properties of naturally occurring silicate melts at high pressures.</p><p>Table <ref type="table">6</ref>. Parameters used in Eqn. 5. The values of for Di and An at low pressure are estimated from stoichiometry <ref type="bibr">(Bottinga and Richet, 1995)</ref>, and for Ab, Jd, and Di 58 An 42 at low pressure are from interpolations between Di and An endmembers (see text). The value of (Ѩ/ѨP) T is calculated based on other parameters, and N 0 is from stoichiometry. The values of for Di and Ab at high pressures are necessary to reproduce ⌬V a in Eqn. 5, keeping all other parameters constant.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Richet et al.
