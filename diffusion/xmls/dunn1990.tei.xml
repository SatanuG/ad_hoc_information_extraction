<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The chemical diffusion of ferrous iron has been measured in a peraluminous sodium aluminosilicate melt using a diffusion couple technique. Polythermal measurements (1250ø-1450øC) were made at 0.1 MPa and at 1.0 GPa and polybafie measurements (0.1 MPa to 2.0 GPa) were made at 1400•C in order to determine the temperature and pressure dependencies of ferrous iron diffusion. The 0.1 MPa polythermal results show that the diffusivity of ferrous iron is non-Arrhenian at temperatures below 1300•, but is Arrhenian at higher temperatures. The non-Arrhenian behavior is interpreted either as indicating temperature dependent ankmie disproportion in the melt or as being due to a change in the diffusive jump frequency from similar to that of Si-O bond exchange to faster than Si-O bond exchange with increasing temperature. The 0.1 MPa data are adequately described by a Fulcher equation: log•oD = -7.16_+0.79 -2805:43/(T-1366), where the diffusion coefficient is in units of em2/s and T is the absolute temperature. The 1.0 GPa polythermal results are adequately described by an Arrhenius equation: log•0D = 1.87_-4-0.07 -297,400+_q9,000/2.303RT, where the diffusive activation energy is 297+_39 kJ/mol. The polybafic results show that there is a significant increase in ferrous iron diffusivity from 0.1 MPa to 0.6 GPa, but that the diffusivity is independent of pressure at higher pressures. The sharp change in the diffusivity is interpreted as indicating changes in the melt structure via artionic disproponionation reactions (e.g., 2Q ø (-• Q? + Q4) with large (greater than -34 em3/mol) negative volume changes that occur somewhere in the 0.1 MPa to 0.6 GPa pressure range. 1. Ime. m)ucuo• The structural role of iron in melts and the resulting chemical (activity-composition relationships [e.g., Dickenson and Hess, 1986; Doyle, 1988; Gwinn and Hess, 1989]) and physical (density and partial molar volume [Lange and Carmichael, 1987; Dingwell eta/., 1988; Dingwell and Brearley, 1988]; viscosity [Dingwell and Virgo, 1988]) manifestations of that role have recently been the subject of extensive study. Iron is an extremely important element in magmatic systems because of 1987], few studies have dealt with the iron's diffusion kinetics [e.g., Henderson et al., 1985] and no work has been reported on the effect of redox state on iron's diffusivity. Dickenson and Hess [1986] and Gwinn and Hess [1989] have demonstrated that ferrous iron is stabilized in peraluminous melts relative to peralkaline melts. They have also demonstrated that ferric iron does not compete effectively with aluminum for charge balancing cations. Thus, in peraluminous melts, ferric iron must either be in octahedral (O•) coordination [Mysen, 1988], in tetrahedral (T•) coordination charge balanced by ferrous its variable redox state and because it is an essential component iron, or in T• tri-c!usters [Dickenson and Hess, 1986]. In in a wide variety of common rock forming minerals (e.g., olivine, pyroxenes, biotite, amphiboles, garnets, and oxide minerals). Because minerals almost never contain iron in the same redox state or at the same concentration as in the coexisting melts, crystal growth akers not only the iron content but also the redox ratio of the iron in the melt. In static systems, the resulting concentration and redox gradients can only be eliminated by a combination of iron diffusion and redox reactions in the compositionally modified melt adjacent to the growing crystal (in dynamic systems advective motion of sinking crystals or eonvecting melt can also eliminate such gradients). While many studies have addxessed iron's chemical and structural behavior in melts [e.g.,</p></div>

The melt chosen for study also acts as an analog of peraluminous granitic melts. The experiments were all done by diffusion couple methods in which one half of the couple was iron-free and the other half of the couple contained a small (1.25 wt % iron as FeO) amount of iron. The iron doping level was chosen to provide a measureable iron concentration gradient while not introducing significant concentration gradients (equal to or less than 0.5 mol %, relative) for the other elements in the system. The experimental design minimizes contributions to the total diffusive flux of iron due to off-diagonal elements in the diffusion matrix by minimizing the chemical potential gradients driving those fluxes <ref type="bibr">[Dunn,</ref><ref type="bibr">!987</ref>].</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Preparation of Starting Materials</head><p>The experiments were done using starting materials from a single !0-g batch. The starting glass was prepared from reagent grade silicic acid (fired for 24 hours at 850 ø C to produce SiO2), Al•O•, and Na•COa. The reagent powders were thoroughly mixed by shaking in a SPEX mixing mill, fired in air at 1000øC to, decompose the Na2CO• and the resulting sintered pellet was ground to a fine powder in an agate mortar. The decarbonated oxide mix was then put through four cycles of fusion for ! hour at 1450øC at an oxygen fugaeity appropriate to the planned experimental conditions followed by grinding in an agate mortar. All controlled atmosphere fusions were done in a MoSi2 resistance furnace. Furnace atmospheres were CO/CO2 gas mixtures to produce an oxygen fugacity approximately on the FMQ buffer. Reducing atmospheres were generated and controlled with an automated gas flow control/oxygen fugacity monitoring system <ref type="bibr">[Dunn, 1990]</ref>. After the fourth fusion, the glass was split into two aliquots one of which was ground to a grain size of less than 75 Iaaa (-200 mesh). The other aliquot was doped with iron (as reagent grade FenOs) to a nominal level of 1.25 wt % iron as FeO. The doped glass powder was put through four additional fuse/crush cycles to produce a homogenous glass with all iron in the ferrous redox state. After the fourth fusion, the doped glass was ground to a -200 mesh grain size. Care was taken to ensure that both the iron-free and iron-doped glasses were prepared under the same redox conditions.</p></div>

The diffusion couples were prepared from pellets of iron-free and iron-doped glass. Each pellet was prepared from 300 mg of glass powder which was pressed into a 1.27-em-diameter pellet with a standard IR pellet die (no binder was used during pellet preparation). The pellets were then melted for I hour, at the temperature and oxygen fugacity of the experiment for which they were to be used, to produce a glass monolith (a longer fusion duration was not required because the glass had been preredueed under similar conditions during preparation). After the fusion, the pellets were ground flat on one side and sequentially polished to a •'mal grit size of 0.3 •tm (using SiC and alumina polishing media). The polished pellets were cut into four equal parts. Diffusion couples were prepared by tying two pellets (one iron-free and one iron-doped) together with platinum wire so that the polished faces were in contact. The  </p></div>

Graphite capsules were used for all runs to eliminate iron loss to the capsule and to impose reducing conditions to keep virtually all of the iron in the ferrous state <ref type="bibr">[Dunn, 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr">Kress and Carmichael, 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr">Luth and Brearley, 1989</ref>]. Experiments were done using a diffusion couple technique. Dried (110øC) iron-doped glass powder was tightly packed into a graphite capsule and pressed fiat with the polished end of a steel rod machined to match the inner diameter of the capsule. Iron-free glass was then carefully packed into the top half of the capsule. Immediately prior to the run, the capsule and the crushable ceramic components of the piston-cylinder assembly were briefly fitred to 1000øC to eliminate adsorbed water. The components and the capsule were assembled and loaded into the piston-cylinder apparatus while hot, and the run was initiated immediately.</p><p>The experiments were run by cold pressing the samples to a pressure 0.2-0.3 GPa above the desired run pressure, heating to approximately 800øC over a period of 60-120 s and then heating rapidly (10-25 s) to the run temperature. At the end of the nm, the power to the heater was turned off causing the system to cool rapidly (5-6 s to cool below 1000øC), thus quenching the sample. Temperatures were measured using uncalibrated Pt-Pt•Rhn thermocouples located approximatley 1 mm above the top of the grapMte capsule (separated by a thin fitred ceramic spacer). Temperatures are thought to be accurate to within +10øC. Pressures were measured with a calibrated Boutdon tube guage and are thought to be accurate to within :k-0.1 GPa (based on calibration runs using the albite,,jadeite, quartz equilibrium (D. Carill, personal communication, 1988)). The quenched samples were cast in epoxy, cut perpendicular to the diffusive interface and mounted for electron microprobe analysis.</p><p>Experimental conditions are summarized in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>.</p></div>

Once the diffusion proErie had been located, another scan was done with a smaller step size (step sizes varied depertding on the total length of the diffusion profile but were chosen to give approximately 20 points within the profile). No corrections were made for thermal contraction of the samples during the quench because it is not known at what temperature the molar volume of the melt was quenched.</p><p>Two samples (nms 22 and 26, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>) were analyzed with the ARL SEMQ electron microprobe at the University of Alberta. The analytical conditions were 15-keV acceleration potential, 20-rtA sample ctrrent (Faraday cup measurement), and 60-s counting time. All elements (Si, A1, Na, and Fe) were determined at each spot.

The experiments done in this study all meet the criteria for diffusion in a semi-infinite composite media (i.e., diffusion couples). As noted above, the choice of the melt composition and the design of the diffusion couples minimizes the contribution from cross diffusion coefficients (off-diagonal elements in the Onsager diffusion matrix <ref type="bibr">[Dunn, 1986]</ref>). In addition, because the iron concentration is small, it is reasonable to assume that iron's diffusion coefficient is concentration independent.

However, the presence of some ferric iron in the system complicates interpretation of the diffusion profiles.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">D•scussxoN</head><p>The following discussions are predicated on the assumption that aluminum in the peraluminous melt studied occupies a combination of Ta coordinated sites (charge balanced by sodium) and higher coordination number sims (i.e. fivefold and sixfold sites). Furthermore, aluminum is assumed not to occupy Ta tricluster sims. These assumptions are based on recent 27A1 nuclear magnetic resonance results that support the presence of fourfold, fivefold, and sixfold aluminum coordination in peraluminous melts <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[Kirkpatrick, 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Sato et al., 1989</ref>].

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Non-Arrhenian Behavior of 0.I MPa Ferrous Iron Diffusion</head><p>The non-Arrhenian temperature dependence of the 0.1 MPa ferrous iron diffusivities (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2</ref>) strongly suggests that the structure of the melt changes with increasing temperature. The variability of the temperature dependence of ferrous iron diffusivity (Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>) indicates that the most significant melt structural changes occur at lower temperatures. Other evidence for changes in melt structure with temperature was recently presented by <ref type="bibr">Brandriss and Stebbins [1988]</ref>, who studied the effect of temperature on the structure of several melts, including a sodium disilicate melt (NDS), via •Si nuclear magnetic resonance spectrocsopy. For the NDS melt, they suggested that the following disproportionation reaction took place as Physically, this interpretation means that at low temperatures, the matrix through which the iron is diffusing is changing on the ß time scale of the diffusive jump and the diffusing iron experiences a dynamic environment during the diffusion process. However, as the diffusive jump frequency increases with increasing temperature and exceeds that of Si-O bond exchange, the diffusing iron will experience an essentially static environment. Thus, there are two different temperature dependence regimes. At lower temperatures the temperature dependence of iron diffusion is complex and is a combination of the temperature dependences of the diffusive jump frequency and the Si-O (A1-O) bond exchange frequencies. At higher tempertin:es, the temperature dependence is simply that of the diffusive jump frequency. If this interpretation is valid, then ferrous iron diffusion should be coupled to viscosity at low temperature and decoupled at higher temperature.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Effect of Pressure on the Diffusivity of Ferrous Iron</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref> shows that the 1400øC diffusivity of ferrous iron increases by more than half an order of magnitude between 0.1 MPa and 0.6 GPa, and Figure <ref type="figure">7</ref> shows that the increase is a general effect over the entire temperature range investigated (1250ø-1450øC). Similar apparently sharp changes in diffusion coefficients with pressure have been observed by other workers. <ref type="bibr">Dunn [1983]</ref>  Solid-solid calculations using tabulated thermochemical data <ref type="bibr">[Robie et aI., 1979</ref>] suggest that at 1400øC, mullitc will break down to corundum plus quartz at approximately 0.9 OPa. Thus, it seems reasonable to suggest that the mews liquidus phase may change from mullitc to corundum at a sirrdlar pressure and that there might be an associated change in melt structure. If the hypothesized melt structural change is due to a disproportionation reaction like (14), which reduces the proportion of of Q3 species in favor of Q• and Q• species, then aluminum might be expected to be partitioned into the Q4 species <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[Mysen et al., 1980]</ref>. Such a redistribution of aluminum would tend to increase the fragility of the fully polymerized portion of the melt [$camehorn and Angell, 1989], which could enhance the diffusion coefficients of network modifier components like ferrous iron.</p><p>An alternative explanation for the increase in iron diffusivity with increasing pressure can be drawn from studies of the pressure dependence of melt viscosity. Scarfe et al. <ref type="bibr">[1979]</ref> noted that the compressibility of melts with a negative pressure dependence of viscosity (such as the melt being examined in this study) is much greater than that of melts with a positive pressure dependence (less polymerized melts). <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Mysen et al. [1980]</ref> suggested that this may be caused by a collapse of the The polybaric results show that there is a significant increase in ferrous iron diffusivity from 0.1 MPa to 0.6 GPa but that the diffusivity is independent of pressure at higher pressures. The sharp change in the diffusivity is interpreted as indicating changes in the melt structure via anioni½ disproportionation reactions (e.g., 2Q 3 --&gt; Q2 + Q4) with large (greater than -34 cm•/mol) negative volume changes that occur somewhere in the 0.1 MPa to 0.6 GPa pressure range.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>diffusion couples were placed in a platinum crucible, with the iron-doped half of the couple on the bottom, and the crucible was introduced into the cold zone (&lt;300øC) of the controlled. atmosphere furnace, preset to the desired temperaWe and oxygen fugacity, and left for 30-60 min to exchange any air trapped between the two halves of the diffusion couple with the furnace atmosphere.

The effect of the disproportionation reaction (14) on the diffusivity of ferrous iron may be explained as follows. With increasing temperature (14) produces both more polymerized and less polymerized silicate artionic species, while leaving the bulk melt NBO/T unchanged. Changing the artionic speciation in the melt would certainly change the detail of the diffusion mechanism for ferrous iron. Consequenfiy, if the nature of the matrix that ferrous iron diffuses through changes with temperature, the temperature dependence of the diffusion coefficient of ferrous iron should not be constant. The observed curvature of the ferrous iron diffusion data on the Arrhenius plot (Figure. 2) is consistent with either continuous or discontinuous change in the artionic speciation of the melt with increasing temperature. Brandriss and Stebbins [1988] interpreted their data in terms of a continuous artionic disproporfionafion reaction. Therefore a continuous change in the temperature depence of the ferrous iron diffusion coefficient is favored. The present data set does not constrain the diffusion mechanism. However, if the an/onic speciation in the melt does change as described by reaction (14), then the data imply that the temperature dependence for ferrous iron diffusion in melts dominated by Qa and Q4 species is larger than for QLQ 4 species dominated melts. An alternative explanation for the non-Arrhenian behavior was recently suggested by Dingwell and Webb [1989], based on consideration of the relative time scales of the various dynamic processes going on in the melt. The non-Arrhenian behavior at low temperature (&lt;1300øC) may reflect a crossover of the diffusive jump frequency of ferrous iron and the Si-O bond exchange frequency. In that context, the diffusion data indicate that the diffusive jump frequency for ferrous iron is similar to the Si-O bond exchange frequency at temperatures less than 1300øC, but with increasing temperature (i.e., T&gt;1300øC) the diffusive jump frequency exceeds that of Si-O bond exchange.</figDesc></figure>

Similar apparently sharp changes in diffusion coefficients with pressure have been observed by other workers.Dunn [1983]  and Dunn and Scarfe [1986] observed significant decreases in the diffusion coefficient of oxygen in silicate melts and Dingwell and Scarfe [1984, 1985] found that the binary interdiffusion coefficient of fl•orine and oxygen in jadeitc melt increased dramaticaly from 0.1 MPa to 1.0 GPa. Dunn [1983] and Dunn and Scarfe [1986] interpreted the sharp changes in oxygen diffusion in terms of pressure induced anionic disproportionation reactions (similar to the temperature induced reactions discussed above) that were related to changes in the liquidus mineralogy of the melts studied.

This would increase the number of nearest oxygen neighbors, which would, in ram, increase the average coordination number of the metal cations (i.e., decrease the effective bond strength between metal carlons and nearest neighbor oxygens). A reduction in metal-oxygen bond strengths or a decrease in the effective charge to radius ratio would result in an increase in diffusivity. While the present results do indicate that the structure of the melt studied changes with increasing pressure and that the changes occur primarily at low pressure (0) were made at 1400øC in order to determine the temperature and pressure dependencies of ferrous iron diffusion. The 0.1 MPa polythermal results show that the diffusivity of ferrous iron is non-Arrhenian at temperatures below 1300øC but is A.rrhenian at higher temperatures. The non-Arrhenian behavior is interpreted either as indicating temperature dependent anionic disproportion in the melt or as being due to a change in the diffusive jump frequency from similar to that of Si-O bond exchange to faster than Si-O bond exchange with increasing temperature. The 0.1 MPa data are adequately described by a Fulcher equation over the temperature range studied, but an Arrhenius equation is adequate to describe the data for temperatures above 1300øC. In contrast, the 1.0 GPa polythermal results are adequately described by an Arrhenius equation with an activation energy of 297_-t:39 k.l/mol.</figDesc></figure>
